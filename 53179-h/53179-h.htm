<span class="titlefont">THE CAPTAIN</span></h2>


<p>Captain Blood used to come down to McGinnis’
wharf every afternoon to have a look
round. The Captain was an Irishman of the
black-haired, grey-eyed type from the west
coast&mdash;a relic of the wreck of the Spanish
Armada.</p>

<p>The Spanish strain in the Celtic nature
makes for volcanic developments; and the
Captain, from what we knew of him, formed
no exception to this rule. He was known as
“The Captain” <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout court</i> all along the front
at San Francisco, from the China docks to
Meiggs’ Wharf. He was a character.
Scarcely forty years of age, he had done most
things that a man could possibly do in the way
of sea-and-land adventure. He had run guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in the Spanish-American War, dug for gold
at Klondike with the first batch of diggers,
lost two fingers of his left hand in a dust-up on
the Chile coast, and two ships in a manner
considered dubious by the Board of Trade.
But he never had lost a friend, nor an enemy.
Unlike most of his class, he had nothing of the
amphibian about him. Straight and well set
up, he always managed to keep a clean, well-groomed
appearance even in the teeth of adversity.</p>

<p>The Captain was seated to-day on a mooring
bitt, watching the freighters loading with
grain and the tugs and Italian whitehalls passing
on the blue water of the bay. He was
down on his luck, had been for the last month,
and was in a condition of humour with the
world that would have lent him to any job
from piracy to the captaining of a hay barge.</p>

<p>Owners had fought shy of him ever since
his last deep-sea adventure. Capable and
sober enough, he had earned a reputation for
recklessness that was a bar to employment as
fatal as a reputation for drink. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
no more Klondikes to be exploited, perfect
peace reigned on the west American seaboard
from Vancouver to Wellington Island, piracy
was out of date, and every hay barge had its
captain.</p>

<p>There seemed no prospect before him but
either to go into the fo’c’sle or go on tramp,
and as he sat on the mooring bitt, kicking his
heels and watching the shipping, he was trying
to decide which of these two prospects was
the more hateful.</p>

<p>He had arrived at no decision on this point
when he saw a figure approaching him. It
was Billy Harman.</p>

<p>“Why, there you are!” said Billy. “Just the
man I wanted to see. I looked into Sam
Brown’s, and you weren’t there, and Sam said:
‘Try down on the wharves; the Captain is sure
to be down on the wharves on the lookout for
his ship.’”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach him to talk about me and my affairs,”
said Blood. “Well, now you’ve found
me, what have you got for me?”</p>

<p>“A ship,” replied Harman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you got it in your pocket?” said the
Captain. “If so, produce it. A ship! And
since what day have you turned owner?”</p>

<p>Mr. Harman produced a pipe and began
to load it carefully and meditatively. His
manner could not have been more detached
had the Captain not been present.</p>

<p>Then, having lit the pipe and taken a draw,
he seemed to remember the presence of the
other.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “it’s a sure-enough job if
you wish to take it. I’d have had it myself,
only I’m no hand at the deep-sea-cable business;
but when the thing was spoken of to me
I said: ‘I’ve got the man you want who can
do any job in that way better’n any man in
Frisco.’ You see, I knew you’d served two
years on the <em>Groper</em>.”</p>

<p>“The <em>Grapnel</em>, you mean.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the same; she were a cable ship,
weren’t she? And I said: ‘If he’ll go, I’ll go
meself as second off’cer. I can do the navigatin’.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the whisky bottle is out of sight,”
put in Blood.</p>

<p>“‘And what’s more,’ said I, ‘I’ll get you a
crew that’s up to snuff and won’t make no
bother nor tell no yarns. You leave the job
to me,’ said I, ‘and if I can get the Captain to
come along it’s fixed,’ I says.”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Bill Harman,” said Blood,
shifting his position on the mooring bitt so as
to get his informant face to face, “what are
you driving at? What do you mean, anyhow?
Who’s the owner of the cable boat that’s willing
to ship you as first mate and me as skipper?
Is this a guy you are letting off on me, or is it
delirium tremens? A cable boat! Why, what
cable company is going to fish round promiscuous
and pick up its officers from sweepings
like you and me?”</p>

<p>“This is no company,” replied Harman.
“It’s a private venture.”</p>

<p>“To lay or to mend?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me,” said Harman, “I’d
say it was more like a breaking job. If you
ask me, I wouldn’t swear to it being an upside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
business, but it’s a hundred dollars a month
for the skipper and a bonus of two thousand
dollars if the job’s pulled off, and half that
for the mate.”</p>

<p>The Captain whistled.</p>

<p>The darkness in this business revealed by
Billy Harman jumped up at him; so did the
two thousand dollars bonus and the hundred a
month pay.</p>

<p>“Who asked you to come into this?” said
he.</p>

<p>“A chap named Shiner,” replied Harman.</p>

<p>“A Jew?”</p>

<p>“A German. I don’t know whether he is a
Jew or not, but he’s got the splosh.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the Captain, half resuming
his place on the mooring bitt with one leg
dangling, “let’s come to common sense. To
begin with, you can’t run a cable boat with a
skipper and a mate and even a couple of
engineers alone. You want an electrician.
Where’s your electrician to come from?”</p>

<p>“You don’t want no electricians to cut cables
with,” said Harman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s true,” said the Captain, falling into
meditation.</p>

<p>“Yet, all the same,” went on Harman, “this
chap Shiner said we would want an electrician,
and that he’d come as electrician himself.
Says he has a good knowledge of the
work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he said that, did he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess he told no lie. This chap
Shiner is no bar bummer by a long chalk. I
reckon he’s all there.”</p>

<p>The Captain made no reply. He was thinking.
At first he had fancied this to be a simple
business; some rascal person or syndicate wishing
to cut a deep-sea cable and so interrupt
communication between the business centres.
There were only two or three Pacific cables
where this piece of rascality could bring any
fruitful results. That is to say, there were
only two or three cables the cutting of which
would not have been negatived by collateral
cables or wireless, and the simple cutting of
those cables could not conceivably produce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
financial result worth the risk and the cost of
an expedition.</p>

<p>But this was evidently more than a simple
cutting job, since the presence of an electrician
was required.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said he, “where is this man
Shiner to be seen?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Harman, “he’s to be seen easy
enough in his office on Market Street.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go and have a look at him,”
said the Captain, detaching himself from the
mooring bitt. “He’s worth investigating.
Would he be in now, think you?”</p>

<p>“He might,” replied Harman. “Anyhow,
we can try.”</p>

<p>They walked away together.</p>

<p>Harman, unlike Blood, was a typical sailor
of the tramp school, a man who knew more
about steam winches and cargo handling than
masts and yards. He was all right to look at,
a stocky man with a not unpleasant face, a
daring eye, and a fresh colour, but his certificates
were not to match. Drink had been this
gentleman’s ruin. Had he been a lesser man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
drink would have crushed him down into the
fo’c’sle. As it was, he managed to get along
somehow by his wits. He had not made a voyage
for two years now, but he had managed
to make a living; he had been endowed by nature
with a mind active as a squirrel. He was
in with a number of men: ward politicians
knew him as a useful man, and used him occasionally.
Crimps knew him, and tavern
keepers. Had he been more of a scamp and
less of a dreamer, he might have risen high in
life. His dream was of a big fortune to be
“got sudden and easy,” and this dream, stimulated
at times by alcohol, managed somehow
to keep him poor.</p>

<p>The public life of Frisco, like a rotten
cheese, supports all sorts of mites and maggots,
and the wharf edge is of all cheese the
most rotten part.</p>

<p>Harman could put his hand on men to vote
at a city election, or men to man a whaler; he
was under political protection, he was in with
the port officers and the customs, and he could
have been a very considerable person despite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his lack of education but for the drink. Drink
is fatal to successful scoundrelism, and the
form in which it afflicted Harman is the most
fatal of all, for he was not a consistent toper.
He would go sober for months on end, and
then, having made some money and some success,
he would “fly out.”</p>

<p>Having reached Market Street, Harman
led his companion into a big building where
an elevator whisked them up to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Here, at the end of a concrete passage, Harman
pushed open a door inscribed with the
legend “The Wolff Syndicate,” and, entering
an outer office, inquired for Mr. Shiner. They
were shown into a comfortably furnished
room where at a roll-top desk a young man
was seated busily at work with a stenographer
at his side. He asked them to be seated, finished
the few words he had to dictate, and
then, having dismissed the stenographer,
turned to Harman.</p>

<p>Shiner, for it was he, was a very glossy individual,
immaculately dressed in a frock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
coat, broad-striped trousers, spats, and patent-leather
shoes.</p>

<p>He did not look more than thirty&mdash;if that&mdash;he
was good looking, and yet a frankly ugly
man would have produced a more pleasing
impression on the mind than Mr. Shiner. Despite
his good looks, his youth, and his manner,
which was intended to please, there was something
inexpressibly hard and negative about
this individual.</p>

<p>The Captain felt it at once. “Now, there’s
a chap that would do you in and sit on your
corpse and eat sandwiches,” said he to himself,
“and smile&mdash;wonder how Harman got a
hold of a chap like that? But there’s money
here; the place smells of it, and the chap, too.
Well, we’ll see.”</p>

<p>“This is the Captain,” said Harman. “Captain
Blood I spoke of to you. I happened to
meet him, and he’s come in to see you.”</p>

<p>“Very glad to see you, Captain,” said
Shiner, getting up and standing with his back
to the stove. “Has our friend Harman mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to you anything of the business I spoke
of to him?”</p>

<p>“He told me it was cable work,” replied
Blood cautiously.</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Shiner. “I want a skipper
for some work in connection with deep-sea
cables. You have experience, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Two years in the <em>Grapnel</em>,” replied Blood.</p>

<p>“You were skipper?”</p>

<p>“No; first officer.”</p>

<p>“Had you much to do with the cable work?”</p>

<p>“Everything, as far as handling the cable.
You see, in some companies and some boats
they have a regular cable engineer, a chap
who doesn’t touch any work but cable work;
in others, the chief officer does his work and
the cable work as well.”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Shiner, nodding his head
as though he were well acquainted with all
the ins and outs of the business. “Well, in
this affair of ours the skipper would be skipper
and cable engineer as well. That would not
interfere with his proper business, since once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the cable engineer is in charge, he is the virtual
captain of the ship.”</p>

<p>Blood nodded, wondering how this up-to-date-looking
young business man had gained
so much knowledge about this special branch
of seamanship.</p>

<p>“Of course you have certificates,” went on
Shiner. “You can show a clean sheet for character
and ability?”</p>

<p>“Curse his impudence!” thought the Captain
to himself; then, aloud: “A clean sheet?
No, can you?”</p>

<p>Shiner, who had been standing on his toes
and letting himself down on his heels, puffing
out his chest, shooting his cuffs, and otherwise
conducting himself like a man in power and
on a pedestal, collapsed at this dig. He flung
his right elbow into the palm of his left hand,
pinched in his cheeks with his right thumb and
forefinger, coughed, frowned, and then said:</p>

<p>“I can excuse a sailor for being short in his
temper before a question that would seem to
imply incapacity. We will say no more on
that point. I take your word that you are an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
efficient navigator and a capable cable engineer.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t take anything of the sort,”
said Blood. “I’m a bad navigator, and, as for
cable engineering, I can find a cable if I have
a chart of it and howk her out of the mud if I
have a grapnel. I don’t say that doesn’t want
doing; still that’s my limit as a cable man.
And as to navigation, I can just carry on. I’ve
lost two ships.”</p>

<p>“The <em>Averna</em> and the <em>Trojan</em>,” said Shiner.</p>

<p>“Now, how in the nation did you know
that?” cried the outraged Blood.</p>

<p>“I know most things about most men in
Frisco,” replied the subtle Shiner.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you’ll know my back,” replied
Blood, rising from his chair, “and you may
think yourself lucky if you don’t know my
boot!” He turned to the door.</p>

<p>“Captain! Captain!” cried Harman,
springing up. “Don’t take on so for nothing.
The gentleman didn’t mean nothing. Don’t
you, now, be a fool, for it’s me you’ll put out
of a job as well as yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“What made him ask me those questions,
then, and he knowing my record all the time?”
cried Blood, around whose body Harman had
flung an arm.</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean no <em>harm</em>; he didn’t mean
no <em>harm</em>. Don’t you be carrying on so for
nothing; the gentleman didn’t mean no harm.
Here, now, sit you down; he didn’t mean no
harm.”</p>

<p>Harman was not an orator, but his profound
common sense prevented him from enlarging
on the subject and trying to suggest
innocent things that Shiner might have meant.
Blood was in a condition of mind to snap at
anything, but he sat down.</p>

<p>Shiner had said not one word.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Harman, in a soothing
voice. “And now, Mr. Shiner, if I’m not
wrong, it was a hundred dollars a month you
were offering the Captain, with a bonus of a
thousand when the job’s through. Maybe
I’m not mistaken in what I say.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Shiner, speaking as calmly
as though no unpleasant incident had occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“Those are the terms, with an advance
of a hundred dollars should the Captain
engage himself to us.”</p>

<p>“What about the victuals,” said the Captain,
seeming to forget his late emotion, “and the
drinks?”</p>

<p>“The food will be good,” replied Shiner,
“and the best guarantee of that will be the fact
that I go with you myself as electrician. I’m
not the man to condemn myself to bad food for
the sake of a few dollars. The food will be
the best you have ever had on board ship, I
suspect; but there will be no drinks.”</p>

<p>“No drinks?”</p>

<p>“Not till we are paid off. This business
wants cool hands. Tea, coffee, mineral waters
you will have as much as you want of; but not
one drop of alcohol. I am condemning myself
as well as you, so there is no room for
grumbling.”</p>

<p>Harman heaved a sigh like the sigh of a
porpoise. Blood was silent for a moment.
Then he said: “Well, I don’t mind. I’m not
set on alcohol. If it’s to be a teetotal ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
maybe it’s all the better; but I reckon you’ll
pay wind money all the same.”</p>

<p>“What’s this they allow?” asked Shiner, as
though he had forgotten this point.</p>

<p>“A shilling a day on the English ships,”
said the Captain, “for the officers. Eighteen
pence, some of the companies make it. I don’t
know what the skipper gets. I reckon double.
I’ll take half a dollar a day. That’s about
fair.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Shiner. “I meet you.
Anything more?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Captain. “I guess that’s all.”</p>

<p>“When can you start?” asked Shiner.</p>

<p>“When you’re ready.”</p>

<p>“Well, that will be about this day week.”</p>

<p>“And the advance?”</p>

<p>“I will pay you that to-morrow, when you
have seen over the ship. It’s just as well you
should have a look at her first. Can you be
here at ten o’clock to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can be here.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. You had better come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
too, Mr. Harman. I will expect you both at
ten o’clock sharp. Good day to you.”</p>

<p>They went out.</p>

<p>Going down in the elevator, they said
nothing.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that not one of the
three men had made any remark on the real
nature of the forthcoming expedition. It was
admittedly dark. The amount of pay and the
bonus were quite enough to throw light on the
edges of the affair. Blood did not want to explore
farther. It wasn’t the first dark job he’d
been on, and the less he knew the more easily
could he swear to innocence in case of capture.</p>

<p>Harman seemed of this way of thinking
also, for, when they turned into the street, all
he said was:</p>

<p>“Well, come and have a drink.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” said Blood. “I’m not a
drinking man, as a rule; but that chap has
made me feel dry somehow or another.”</p>

<p>He had taken a black dislike to Shiner.</p>

<h2>II<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE “PENGUIN”</span></h2>


<p>Near the docks where the China boats come
in, there lies an old wharf gone pretty much to
decay. Rafferty’s Wharf is the name it goes
by. It bears about the same relationship to the
modern sea front that Monterey bears to San
Francisco, for its rotten piles, bored by sea
weevils and waving their weeds languidly to
the green water that washes them, were young
in the days when grain went aboard ship by the
sackful and the tank ships of the Standard Oil
Company were floating only in the undreamed-of
future.</p>

<p>If you hunt for it, you will find it very difficult
to discover; and if you discover it, you
will gain little by your discovery but melancholy.</p>

<p>The great grain elevators pouring their rivers
of wheat into the holds of the great grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
freighters overshadow it with their majesty,
and go as often as you will, there is never a
decent, live ship moored to its bitts.</p>

<p>The cripples of the sea are brought here for
a rest, or for sale, before starting with a last
kick of their propellers for the breaking-up
yards; and here, on this bright morning, when
Mr. Shiner and his two seafaring companions
appeared on the scene, this veritable cripple
home only showed two inmates&mdash;a brig and a
grey-painted, single-funnelled steamship with
rust runnings staining her paint, verdigris on
her brasswork, no boats at her davits, and a
general air of neglect, slovenliness, and disreputability
beggaring description.</p>

<p>The <em>Penguin</em> had never been a beauty to
look at, and she had always been a beast to roll;
even rolling plates, though they had improved
her a bit, had not cured her. She had only one
good point&mdash;speed&mdash;and that was an accident;
she had not been built for speed; she had been
built to carry cable and to lay it and mend it;
speed had come to her by that law which rules
that to every ship built comes some quality or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
defect not reckoned for by the designer and
builder.</p>

<p>Shiner &amp; Co., having hailed the watchmen,
crossed the gangplank to the desolate deck,
the Captain with frank disapproval on his
face, Harman sniffing and trying to look
cheerful at the same time, like a salesman
keeping a fair face above the rotten game he is
offering for sale.</p>

<p>“Great Neptune!” said the Captain, glancing
around him.</p>

<p>“She is a bit gone to neglect,” said Shiner,
“but it’s all on the surface. She’s as sound as
a bell where it really matters.”</p>

<p>“Them funnel guys,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Yes, they want tightening, and the want of
boats doesn’t make her look any better; but
boats will be supplied according to regulation.
You won’t know her when I’ve had half a
dozen fellows at her for a couple of days. All
that brasswork wants doing, and a lick of paint
will liven her up; but she’s not a yacht, anyhow,
and a sound deck under one’s feet is a
long way better than a good appearance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>He followed the Captain, who had walked
forward to the bow, where the picking-up gear
cumbered the deck.</p>

<p>This consisted of a huge drum moved by
cogwheels and worked through the picking-up
engine by steam from the main boilers. On it
would be wound the grapnel rope used for
grappling for cable over the wheel let into the
bow just at the point where in ordinary ships
the heel of the bowsprit is grasped by the
knightheads.</p>

<p>The Captain inspected this machine with attention,
pressing on the cogs of the driving
wheel with his thumb as though they were
soft and he wished to discover how much they
would dent; then, standing off a bit, he looked
at it with his head on one side, as a knowing
purchaser might look at a horse.</p>

<p>“Wants a drop of lubricating oil,” said
Shiner tentatively.</p>

<p>“Gallons,” replied the Captain. He turned
to the picking-up engine and pulled the lever
over. This he did several times, releasing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and then pulling it over again as if for the
gloomy pleasure of feeling its defects.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Shiner, “what do you think of
the gear and engine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll work,” said the Captain, “but
it will be a good job if they don’t work off
their bedplates.”</p>

<p>“They’ll hold tight enough,” said Harman,
pressing his foot on the brake of the engine.
“There’s nothing wrong with them on the inside.
Let’s have a look at the main.”</p>

<p>They came aft past the electrical testing
room, and passed down the companionway to
the engine room.</p>

<p>Here things were brighter, the weather having
worked no effect.</p>

<p>“I have had them examined by an expert,”
said Shiner. “He gave them an A-1 certificate.
And the boilers are sound; they have
been scaled and cleaned. Let’s go and look at
the saloon.”</p>

<p>They came on deck, and Shiner led the way
down the companionway to the saloon.</p>

<p>It was a big place, with a table running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
down the middle capable of seating twenty or
thirty at a crush. Cabin doors opened on
either side of it; at the stern end it bayed out
into a lounge and a couch upholstered in red
velvet; and at the end, by the door leading to
the companionway, was fixed a huge sideboard
with a mirror backing.</p>

<p>A faint air of old festivity and an odour of
must and mildew lent their melancholy to the
dim, irreligious light streaming down through
the dirty skylight.</p>

<p>The Captain sniffed. Then he peeped into
the cabins on either side, noticed the cockroaches
that made hussar rushes for shelter,
the fact that the doors stuck in their jambs,
that the bunks were destitute of bedding, and
the scuttles of the portholes sealed tight with
verdigris.</p>

<p>“You can have the starboard cabin by the
door,” said Shiner. “I’ll take the port. Or
you can take the chart room; there’s a bunk
there. Harman can have any of the other
cabins he likes. We’ll all mess here, and we
won’t grumble at being tightly packed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll have decent bedding put in?” said
the Captain.</p>

<p>“That will be done, all right,” replied
Shiner. “You need have no fear at all that the
appointments won’t be up to date. There
won’t be frills on the sheets, but there will be
comfort.”</p>

<p>“Well, comfort is all I ask,” replied the
Captain. “And you propose to put out this
day week?”</p>

<p>“This day week. May I take it, now, that
everything is settled?”</p>

<p>The Captain scratched his head for a moment,
as if dislodging a last objection. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll come.”</p>

<h2>III<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE TOP SEAT AT THE TABLE</span></h2>


<p>It was on a Tuesday morning that they
started. Blood came on board at six, and
found the majority of the crew already assembled
under Harman. They had come on
board the night before, and, to use his own
expression, they were the roughest, toughest
crowd he had ever seen collected on one deck.</p>

<p>He was just the man to handle them, and his
first act was to boot a fellow off the bridge
steps where he had taken his perch, pipe in
mouth, and send him flying down the alleyway
forward. Then, following him, he began
to talk to the hands, sending them flying this
way and that, some to clean brasswork and
others to clear the raffle off the decks.</p>

<p>Down below, the boilers were beginning to
rumble, and now appeared at the engine-room
hatch a new figure, with the air of a Scotch terrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
poking up its head to have a look round.</p>

<p>It was MacBean, the chief, second, third,
and fourth engineer in one.</p>

<p>MacBean had the honest look of a Dandie
Dinmont, and something of the facial expression.
He was an efficient engineer; he was on
board the <em>Penguin</em> because he could not get
another job, and that fact was not a certificate
of character. There was scarcely a soul
on board the <em>Penguin</em>, indeed, with the exception
of Shiner, who would not have been somewhere
else but for circumstances over which
they had no control.</p>

<p>The Captain gave MacBean good morning,
had a moment’s talk with him, and then went
aft to see how things were going there.</p>

<p>He found that a steward had been installed,
and that he was in the act of laying breakfast
things at one end of the breakfast table.</p>

<p>The Captain sent him up for his gear which
was on deck, ordered him to place it in the
cabin which he had selected, and then proceeded
to change from the serge suit which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
wore into an old uniform dating from his last
command in the Black Bird line.</p>

<p>As he was finishing his toilet, he heard
Shiner’s voice, and when he came out of his
cabin he found Shiner and Harman seated at
table and the steward serving breakfast.</p>

<p>Shiner had gotten himself up for the sea.
He looked as though he were off for some
cheap trip with a brass band in attendance.
Very few people can bear yachting rig, especially
when it is brand-new; and brass buttons
with anchors on them are as trying to a man’s
gentility as mauve to a woman’s complexion.</p>

<p>The Captain gave the others good morning.
Two things gratified him: the sight of the
good breakfast spread upon the table, and the
fact that the chair at the head of the table was
vacant and evidently reserved for him.</p>

<p>He was about to take his seat when Shiner
stopped him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said he, “but that is Mr.
Wolff’s place.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolff’s place?” said Blood. “And
who the deuce is Mr. Wolff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our senior partner,” said Shiner. “I’m
expecting him every minute.”</p>

<p>Then it was that the Captain noticed a cover
laid beside Harman and evidently intended
for him.</p>

<p>The temper of the man was not intended by
nature to take calmly an incident like this.</p>

<p>The steward was listening, too.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you to understand right away and
here, now,” said he, “that I’m the skipper of
this tub, and that this is my place at the table.
It’s as well to begin as we intend to go on.
Steward, look alive there with the coffee.”</p>

<p>He took his seat at the head of the table,
helped himself to eggs and bacon, and turned
his conversation on Harman. Shiner flushed,
hesitated, lost his balance, and subsided into
his coffee cup. The Captain at a stroke had
taken his position among the after guard.
Wolff might own the ship, and Shiner, too, it
did not matter in the least. The Captain was
boss, and would remain so.</p>

<p>In a moment, when he had finished saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
what he had to say to Harman, he turned to
the other.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said he, “I can’t stop you
bringing all the supercargoes you like on
board&mdash;&mdash;” He stopped, told the steward to
clear out of the saloon, and then, when the man
had disappeared, went on: “Considering I’ve
let myself in for this thing with my eyes shut,
I’ve no right to complain if you brought bears
on board, to say nothing of wolves; but I’d
have taken it kinder if you had let me know
right off at the beginning that the whole firm
was going on the cruise.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Captain,” said Shiner, “you
have spoken truth without knowing it. Wolff
is the whole firm practically. He’s the boss
of this business, to all intents and purposes;
he’s the money behind it all, and the brain, and
he did not want to advertise the fact that he
was coming on board, I suppose, for he is a
man pretty well known in the States. Anyhow,
there are the facts. Wolff is a man that
<em>I</em> don’t mind playing second fiddle to; and if
I don’t mind, I don’t see why you should.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you?” said the Captain. “Well,
I do. I’m captain of this tub, and captain I’ll
remain. I’m risking enough for a hundred
dollars a month and a bonus of a thousand if
this piracy, whatever it is, of yours, comes off,
without losing my status quo as well.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the illiterate Harman,
who had laid down the knife with which he
had been eating so as to attend better to the
dispute.</p>

<p>“It’s what you’ll never have&mdash;the position
of a master mariner and the top seat at the
table.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that word ‘piracy’?”
asked Shiner, with the air of a woman whose
reputation is attacked. “There is no such
thing in this business, and it would be a lot
better for you to be more careful with your
words. Words are dangerous weapons when
flung about like that.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Captain, “call it what you
like. I don’t know what it is, but I’ve signed
on, and I’m not the man to go back on my
word; but, as I just said, I don’t know what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
are after, and I don’t much care, as long as we
steer clear of the gallows.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be talking like that,” said Harman.
“Mr. Shiner, here, ain’t such a fool as to go
within smellin’ distance of any hanging matter.
What we are after may be a bit off colour,
but it’s a business venture in the main. I’ve
asked no questions, but Mr. Shiner has given
me to understand that it was business he was
after, not anything that would lay us by the
heels, so to speak, in any killing matter.”</p>

<p>“What we are after is perfectly plain,” said
Shiner. “Killing! Who talked of killing?
This is, just as you say, a business matter, and
it’s no worse than what’s being done in Frisco
every day, only it’s a bit more adventurous.”</p>

<p>The precious trio finished their breakfast
without any more words, and then went on
deck. They had scarcely reached it when
across the gangplank came a stout, black-bearded
individual followed by a couple of
wharf rats, one bearing luggage, the other two
big cases.</p>

<p>This was Wolff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Shiner introduced him to the Captain, and
then Wolff, followed by the luggage and the
cases, disappeared below.</p>

<p>“He’s not a good sailor,” said Shiner, “but
he’ll be all right after a day or two. Ah, here
come the port authorities. I’ll have a talk
with them. You are all right for starting, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Captain. “I’m ready to cast
off when you are.”</p>

<p>“Right!” said Shiner.</p>

<p>He took the port officers down to the saloon,
and when they came up again they were all
smoking half-dollar perfectos and the traces
of conviviality and good-fellowship were evident.</p>

<p>“They’ve been having drinks,” said Harman
to himself. “Wouldn’t wonder if there
was lush in those cases Wolff brought aboard.
No tellin’.”</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE SAILING OF THE “PENGUIN”</span></h2>


<p>It was noon when the hawsers were cast off
and Captain Blood, in all the glory of command,
standing on the bridge, rang up the engines
and put the telegraph to half speed
ahead.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day, not a cloud in the sky,
and scarcely a ripple of breeze on the water.
The breeze, just sufficient to shake the trade
flags of the shipping, brought with it the whistling
of ferryboats, the hammering of boiler
iron from the shipyards, and a thousand voices
from the multitude of ships.</p>

<p>They nearly scraped the stern wheel off a
Stockton river boat, and then, as if sheering
off from the blasphemy of the Stocktonites,
nosed round and passed the buoy that marks
the shoal water west of Hennessy’s Wharf.
Then down the bay they went with the sunlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
on Alcatraz and the Contre Costa shore,
and away ahead the Golden Gate and a vision
of the blue Pacific.</p>

<p>They passed <a id="Ref_43"></a>Lime Point and took the middle
channel, where the first heave of the outer
sea striding over the bar met them with a
keener touch of wind to back it. The Cliff
House and Point Bonita fell astern, and now,
right ahead, the Farallons sketched themselves
away across the lonely blue of the sea.</p>

<p>The <em>Penguin</em>, bow on to the swell, was behaving
admirably, so well, indeed, that Wolff,
with a cigar in his mouth, had appeared on
deck and climbed onto the bridge. But now,
clear of the land and with a shift of helm, the
beam sea produced its effect, and her rolling
capacities became evident.</p>

<p>Wolff descended, leaving the bridge to its
lawful occupants, and even Shiner, who had
taken his place on the after gratings with an
account book and stylograph pen, retired after
a very little while.</p>

<p>The <em>Penguin</em> was built to hold a thousand
miles of cable in her fore end and after tanks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and, loaded like that, the effect of her top-hamper
in the way of picking-up gear, picking-up
engine, derricks, and buoys would be
corrected. But she had no cable in her now,
only water ballast, and she rolled after her natural
bent, and rolled and rolled till cries of
“Steward!” came faintly through the saloon
hatch, followed by other sounds and the clinking
of basins.</p>

<p>Blood walked the bridge with Harman,
casting now and then an eye at the compass
card and the fellow at the wheel, and now and
then an eye at the forward deck lumbered with
the gear and four or five new-painted buoys,
each numbered and each with a lamp socket.</p>

<p>“They haven’t spared expense in fitting her
out,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t,” replied the Captain.
“And why? Simply because I’ve been at
Shiner all the past week with a rope’s end, so
to say. I’m blessed if the blighter didn’t want
to economise on buoys! ‘Two will be enough,’
says he; ‘it’s only a short job we are on, and
they are three hundred dollars apiece.’ He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
said that right to my face. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘it’s
none of my business, but if you want to drop
the job, whatever it is, in the middle, and run
a thousand miles to the nearest port for a ten-cent
buoy, you’ll find your economy has been
misplaced. You will that.’ So he caved in
on the buoys. Then we had an argument over
the grapnel rope. He wanted to take two
miles of all hemp. I wanted five miles of wire
wove. I got it, but only after a mighty tough
struggle. The grapnels are good, but they
went with the ship, and they’d been properly
laid up in paraffin; not a speck on them. Then
the Kelvin sounder was out of order. Yes,
they’d have sailed with it like that only for me,
and it cost them something to have it put
right.”</p>

<p>“What I’m thinking,” said Harman, “is
that this expedition is costing a good deal of
money.”</p>

<p>“It’s costing all of five hundred dollars a
day.”</p>

<p>“What I’m thinking,” went on Harman,
“is that the profits to come out of whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
they are going to do must be huge, big profits
to cover the expenses, and I’ve taken notice
that when chaps are ketched going on the
crooked where money is concerned, they always
gets a bigger doing from the law the bigger
the money is. It’s this way: if a chap nails
a suit of clothes, or a ham, he don’t get as much
as a chap that nicks a motor boat, shall we
say, and the chap that nicks a motor boat
don’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” said the Captain. “We’re
in for it, whatever it is, and our only hope’s
our innocence if we’re caught. We don’t know
anything; we are only obeying the orders of
the owners. Not that that will have much
weight if we are caught, but we’re not going
to be. I’ve a firm belief in that slippery eel of
a Shiner, much as I dislike him; and this chap
Wolff doesn’t seem a fool, either. They’re
not the sort of fellows to run their skins into
much danger.”</p>

<p>“What do you think it is?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“Think what is?”</p>

<p>“This game of theirs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what I think. I think
they are going to pick up a cable, cut it, and
tap it.”</p>

<p>“Whatcha mean by tapping it?”</p>

<p>“Sucking the news out of it. Or maybe
they’re going to use it for sending some lying
message that’ll upset the stock markets, or
grain markets, or railway people. Lord bless
you, there’s a hundred things to be done if one
has the business end of a real deep-sea cable
with a big city like Frisco or maybe Sydney
at the other end.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe there is,” said Harman.
“There’s a good many things to be done in
Frisco off the square, without a cable, and
there’s no sayin’ what mightn’t be done with
one.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re a judge of that,” laughed
the Captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m pretty well up to the tricks of
Frisco,” said the other complacently. “But
this is a new traverse, fooling folk from the
middle of the ocean, one might say. I reckon
Wolff is a German, ain’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a Dutchman, all right; so’s
Shiner, I reckon. German Jew. It lands me
how those sort of chaps get on and make
money, and the likes of us has to take their
orders and their leavings. I’d like to get even
with them once.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you will,” said Harman.</p>

<p>The Captain grunted.</p>

<p>There was a fellow on board named Bowers.
He had been given the post of bos’n, and
he knew something of navigation and could
keep a watch on the bridge.</p>

<p>The Captain called for him now and gave
the bridge over to him, as all was plain sailing
with the California coast away on the port
quarter, the Farallons on the starboard bow,
and the whole blue Pacific Ocean right ahead.</p>

<p>He and Harman, leaving the bridge, sought
the chart room and went in there for a smoke.
It was a pleasant place, full of light, and with
a couch running along one side. By the door
stood a rack of rifles, eight in number, and for
every rifle a cutlass.</p>

<p>Cable ships go armed. They never know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when they leave port to do a job, what new job
may not suddenly call them to the Patagonian
beaches or the fogs of the Yellow Sea. The
rifles and cutlasses were part of the fixtures
belonging to the <em>Penguin</em> and taken over by
the new owners, just as fixtures are taken over
with a house. To use them for their proper
purpose could never have occurred to the
minds of Shiner, Wolff &amp; Co. They were
not men of violence. The strange thing, indeed,
about this expedition, organised and
manned for lawless work on the deep sea, was
the fact that the chiefs were, to use Harman’s
phrase, “sure-enough city men,” and that they
were even now down below dead sick with the
Pacific’s first fringe of swell.</p>

<p>Harman took a rifle down and examined it,
while Blood, extending his leg on the couch,
lit a pipe.</p>

<p>“Say,” said Harman, “are you any good as
a shot?”</p>

<p>“Not with a thing like that,” replied the
Captain. “I can hit a man with a revolver at
ten paces, and that’s all the good shooting I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
want. Put that thing down and don’t be fooling
with it.”</p>

<p>“It’s not loaded,” replied Harman, who had
opened the breech.</p>

<p>“And it’s not likely to be,” replied the other,
“for there’s no ammunition on board and no
need for it. If we’re caught, there must be
no fighting.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you was a fighting man,”
said Harman, putting the rifle back. “You
have the name for it.”</p>

<p>“And so I am, when fighting is to be had on
the square; but there’s fighting and fighting.
Can’t you see, if we were caught tinkering at
some cable we had no right to be meddling
with, and if we were chased by some gunboat,
and if we were to fight and draw blood&mdash;can’t
you see we’d be hanged without benefit of
clergy? No, I never fight against the law.
Never have and never will.”</p>

<p>“Suppose a cruiser overhauled her when we
was at work?” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s easier to say than that we
were sent to mend? We are a sure-enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
cable ship, and how’s a cruiser to know
whether the cable we are fishing for or tinkering
with isn’t broken? Oh, no; you may make
your mind easy on that. Our position is sound
and safe, on the outside. Inside it’s as rotten
as punk.”</p>

<h2>V<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE CABLE MESSAGE</span></h2>


<p>The <em>Penguin</em>, steering a sou-sou’westerly
course, slipped day by day into warmer and
bluer seas. Wolff, recovering from his first
unpleasantness, appeared on deck, cigar in
mouth; and Shiner, with nothing better to do,
would be seen lounging on the after gratings
with a novel in his hand.</p>

<p>The Captain and Harman worked the ship,
and had little to do with the others, meeting
them chiefly at table, where, needless to say,
the Captain took the head. Wolff had given
him a chart of the Pacific whereon was laid
down the exact position of the cable they were
going to attend to.</p>

<p>“This is the chart,” Wolff had said. “You
will see, there is the cable. It is plainly
marked. I wish you to bring us to it about
here.” He made a pencil mark on the cable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
line. “And when you have brought us to that
point, then I will explain to you the object of
this expedition.”</p>

<p>“Right!” said the Captain.</p>

<p>They were steering now for the cable line
through days of sapphire and nights wonderful
with stars. Now and then they would
raise an island, a peak with a turban of clouds,
or an atoll, just a green ring of palms and
breadfruits surrounded by a white ring of
foam, and peak and atoll would heave in sight
and sink from sight with nothing to tell of the
legerdemain at work but the pounding of the
screw and the throb of the engines.</p>

<p>Sometimes a sail would heave in sight, or
the far-off smoke of a steamer hold the imagination
for an hour or two, and then be
painted out, leaving nothing but the sea, the
sky, and the pearl-white trace of cloud
draping the skirts of the warm trade wind.</p>

<p>There is no place in the world where grievances
sprout so well and grow so rapidly as on
board ship. The Captain had a grievance. It
had come to his knowledge that Wolff had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
private stock of Pilsener. Some had come in
the cases that the wharf rat had carried after
him on board, and there was more stowed
away in some hole known only to Wolff and
Shiner.</p>

<p>Those two worthies would forgather of a
morning in Wolff’s cabin and drink Pilsener
and then heave the bottles out of the porthole.
The Captain had seen a Pilsener bottle going
aft, bobbing and bowing to him in the wake,
and his fury was excessive and ill contained.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the meanness of proclaiming
the ship teetotal and then smuggling drink
aboard for private consumption, there was
something of cold-blooded inhospitality about
the business that struck at the Irish heart.</p>

<p>He was very explicit about the matter to
Harman:</p>

<p>“Swine&mdash;they and their lager beer! You
wait! I’ll pay them out.”</p>

<p>“To think of them sitting there drinking,
and we dry!” said the simple-minded Harman.
“That’s what gets me. We dry and
them chaps drinking. It makes me thirsty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
I don’t care a dash about their sitting there
and drinking, but when I think of it it makes
me thirsty. That’s what gets me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to think of something
else,” said the Captain. “There’s no use in
dwelling on things like that, and the voyage
is not for long.”</p>

<p>“It’s long enough to be without a drink in,”
said Harman.</p>

<p>Harman, despite his up-to-dateness on San
Francisco roguery, was a most extraordinary
child for all his manhood. The man part of
him had grown up and grown crooked; the
child part of him had remained virginal. The
moment was everything to him. He could
just read and write his name, and sometimes,
when he was off duty, you would see him
spelling over a San Francisco paper. Houses
to let, governess wanted&mdash;it was all the
same to him. He only read the advertisement
columns. They satisfied his craving for literature,
and he could understand them. The
rest of the paper, from the poetry corner to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the foreign-news column, was arid ground for
him.</p>

<p>Yet this same man had made money out
of ward politics and in twenty other ways in
which one would have fancied education necessary
to success.</p>

<p>They left Fanning and Christmas Island
three hundred miles to starboard, passed the
equator, and, entering the great, empty space
of sea bounded by the Phœnix Islands on the
north and the Penrhyns on the southeast,
headed toward the Navigators.</p>

<p>One sweltering morning, the Captain, coming
up to Wolff, who was seated in his pajamas
under the double awning that had been
rigged up, said:</p>

<p>“We’re just on the cable line.”</p>

<p>Wolff rose up, called for the steward, and,
having sent for his panama, put it on and
came up on the bridge.</p>

<p>The sea was smooth, surface smooth, but
underrun by the long, endless swell of the Pacific.</p>

<p>“This is the spot,” said the Captain, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had been poring over the cable chart which
he had brought up on the bridge. “And it’s
pretty deep. All a mile.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Wolff. “With this calm sea,
we ought to work well and quickly. We are
in luck; and now, if you will come into the
chart house, we will talk for one moment.”</p>

<p>They went into the chart house, and Wolff
shut the door.</p>

<p>“This is a purely business proposition,” began
Wolff, “and I must tell you, to begin with,
that it is not a business which a man of a certain
type of mind would call on the square.
But, my dear Captain, can you show me
any business proposition that is truly on
the square? Not one. I want the use of a
cable, and I am going to take it for business
purposes. That is all there is to it, you understand.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Blood, “this is all I know
of the business. You want me to fish this cable
up?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Cut it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>“Connect both ends with the electrical testing
room, and let you talk through it and send
messages through it from both or one of the
cut ends?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly the position.”</p>

<p>“Well, after that?”</p>

<p>“After I have had my use of the cable, you
can drop both ends overboard. We will sail
away, and no one the wiser. Of course, the
cable company will recognise that their cable
is broken, and send a ship to mend it; but we
will be far away by that time.”</p>

<p>“I see,” went on the Captain, “that it runs
from the American coast here to the Australian
coast here, but I don’t know the name
of the company it belongs to; I don’t know
what in the nation your game is. I am as innocent
as a baa lamb on the whole affair, and
I simply obey your orders, not knowing that
you yourself may not own the cable and that
this mayn’t be a repairing job. If we are
caught, will you bear me out in that statement?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&mdash;not
that your evidence will be much good, I
expect, but, still, it’s better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“If you obey our instructions,” said Wolff,
“I will do as you say; and, to prove that I am
playing fair with you, I will even now give
you a detail of the commercial speculation
that is behind all this business.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear it,” said the Captain.
“I’d much sooner remain innocent. I’m just
an ordinary sailor signed on to do an ordinary
job. I’ll work freer in mind if I know nothing
about the inside of the affair; it’s black
enough on the out.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will leave it at that,” said Wolff,
“and we will now set to work, if you please.”</p>

<p>They came on to the bridge, and the Captain
gave orders for the main engines to be
stopped and the Kelvin sounder to be set to
work. The donkey man had been allotted to
this job, and presently the furious, sewing-machine
whir of the sounder hauling up the
lead came through the silence that had supervened
on the stopping of the engines, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
result was shouted forward: “Eight hundred
fathoms, coral rock.”</p>

<p>Blood, on this result being given to him, left
the bridge and came down to the bow balks
to superintend the lowering of the first buoy.
He had not only to act as cable engineer, but
he had also to instruct the hands in the details
of this work absolutely new to them. A big,
red-painted buoy was swung up against the
burning blue of the sky, a rope with a mushroom
anchor attached to it was fastened to the
buoy; then the anchor was cast overboard,
taking the rope with it, and the buoy, swung
outboard, was dropped. It rode off, bobbing
and ducking on the swell, and the <em>Penguin</em>
steamed on to a point a mile ahead, where another
buoy was dropped in a precisely similar
manner.</p>

<p>The Captain had now his position and his
marks laid down. Somewhere between those
two buoys lay the cable, like a black snake on
the floor of the sea, waiting to be grappled for.</p>

<p>The grapnel rope was now lowered over
the clanking drum of the picking-up gear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the wheel in the bow. This business took half
an hour, and then the <em>Penguin</em>, going dead
slow, began to steam back to the first-mark
buoy, dragging the grapnel after her across
the floor of the sea.</p>

<p>Wolff and Shiner took a great deal of interest
in this part of the business. They stood
at the bow watching the pointer of the dynamometer,
which gave the pull on the rope in
hundredweights; every lump of coral, every
tuft of weed travelled over by the grapnel
made the pointer of the dynamometer jump
and joggle; and at every jump the idea
“Cable!” would leap into the minds of the
speculators and show itself in their eyes.</p>

<p>But the <em>Penguin</em> passed from one mark
buoy to the other without a show of the real
thing; and then she turned and steamed back
on an equally fruitless course.</p>

<p>She was making ready for a third grapple
when the bell went for dinner, and Wolff,
Shiner, and the Captain turned aft and went
below to the saloon.</p>

<p>The Wolff gang were in a bad temper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the meal had scarcely begun when a discussion
broke out.</p>

<p>“It’s a funny thing,” said Shiner, “that we
have not hit the thing yet.”</p>

<p>“We have been twice over the ground,”
said Wolff.</p>

<p>“Sure you haven’t made a mistake in the
spot, Captain?” said Shiner.</p>

<p>The Captain put down the glass of mineral
water he was raising to his lips.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you say what you mean?” said
he. “Why can’t you ask me right out if I
haven’t muddled the navigation and missed
the job? Well, I haven’t. Is that plain?
Some men may doubt their own work, and
there are some men who would be put off by
suspicions flung at them and would say,
‘Maybe I <em>am</em> wrong,’ and pick up his buoys
and move off to another ground and make
fools of themselves. I’m not that sort. Can’t
you see that a cable may be passed over by a
grapnel half a dozen times without the grapnel
catching? It may be glued down with
coral.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just so, just so!” said Shiner, anxious to
pacify. “We never doubted your capacity,
Captain.”</p>

<p>“Never, I’m sure,” said Wolff.</p>

<p>The Captain, somewhat mollified, went on
with his meal, and he was raising the glass
of mineral water for the second time to his
lips when the dead, slow tramp of the engines
ceased.</p>

<p>Immediately on their cessation, through the
open skylight came the clanking sound of the
picking-up gear, and right on that came Harman’s
voice, roaring down the saloon companionway:
“Below, there! We’ve got the
cable!”</p>

<p>In a minute or less, Wolff, Shiner, and the
Captain were in the bows; the Captain on
the bow balks, Shiner and Wolff on the deck.</p>

<p>The great drum, rotating slowly, was hauling
in the grapnel rope, dripping and taut;
the dynamometer registered a strain of seven
tons, and the strain was slowly increasing.</p>

<p>Nothing else could give this result but
cable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure we have got it, Captain?”
asked Wolff.</p>

<p>The Captain looked down at him.</p>

<p>“If that rope was to break under this
strain,” said he, “it would mushroom out like
an open umbrella and cut you to pieces. Better
get up on the bridge. You’re safe there.
Yes, I’m sure we’ve got cable, unless we’ve
grappled a dead whale.”</p>

<p>Wolff and Shiner went up the ladder to the
bridge, and the Captain, relieved of their presence,
continued his work.</p>

<p>It was worth watching.</p>

<p>He was a true-born cable man, and they are
as rare as good violinists. Knowing the depth,
and the length of rope out, and its weight in
sea water, and the weight of the grapnel, he
could tell approximately what was going on
down below; he knew that he was lifting
heavier stuff than ordinary cable, and the
weight could only come from coral incrustations
on it. He knew that the cable must be
glued down here and there, and that haste
would mean a break. Sometimes he stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the picking-gear altogether and trusted to the
rise and fall of the ship on the swell to break
the thing gently up from its attachments. And
still the grapnel rope came in, dripping and
endless, till at last the grapnel itself appeared
with what seemed the bight of a sea serpent
gripped in its unholy claws.</p>

<p>The thing was crusted here and there with
coral, it is true, but it was comparatively new
and sound, and a genuine, straight-going
cable man would have shuddered at the sacrilege
that was going on. Even the Captain
felt qualms. To cut this thing was like murder;
it would mean a dead loss of ten or fifteen
thousand dollars to the company that owned
it. An expedition would have to be fitted out
to repair it, and if bad weather were to come
on, it might be three months before the repairs
were effected.</p>

<p>The Captain thought of all this even as he
was ordering the stoppers to be got ready and
the sling for the man who would do the cutting.
He drowned remorse in the recollection
that the injury would be done to a company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
not to an individual. He would not
have injured an individual of his own free
will for worlds, but he did not mind much injuring
a company. A company was a many-headed
beast, and, in his experience, it always
dealt hardly with its employés.</p>

<p>The cable was high out of the water now,
in the form of an inverted V, with the grapnel
at the apex. He ordered each limb of the
bight to be secured with a stopper, and then,
unable to trust any one else with the delicate
business, he himself descended in a sling to do
the cutting. Shouting his directions to the
fellows who were lowering him, he came just
level with the grapnel and began the business
with a file. Halfway through, he ordered the
grapnel to be eased away, finished the business,
and left the two cable ends hanging by
the stoppers.</p>

<p>Then he came aboard, and the starboard
end of the cable was hauled in. It did not take
long to connect it up with the electrical testing
room, where Shiner was already installed
before the mirror galvanometer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The end they had hauled on board was the
American end; the testing-room door was
shut, the blinds of the windows drawn, for a
subdued light is necessary to the proper working
of the mirror galvanometer; and Shiner
and Wolff were left alone with the American
continent to work their dark schemes.</p>

<p>Said Harman, as he paced the deck with
the Captain:</p>

<p>“I wonder what those two guys are doin’
now? Carryin’ out some of their malpraxises,
no doubt. I ain’t a particular man, but this
thing’s beginnin’ to get on my spine. It didn’t
seem much at the start, just foolin’ with a
cable; but now it seems somehow a durned
sight worse, now that the thing’s cut. I tell
you, Cap, it went to my heart to see it cut. I
couldn’t ’a’ felt worse if it’d squealed and
blood run out of it. I guess I wouldn’t have
joined the expedition if I hadn’t been tempted.
I remember my old mother warning me that
if sinners tempted me, not to consent.”</p>

<p>“Confound you and your warnings!” said
the Captain. “Who tempted me? You, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
no one else. But I’m not the man to go back
on you and talk about warnings. We’re in for
it, and there’s no going back, and we can’t do
anything but pray that a cruiser doesn’t heave
in sight before we get away.”</p>

<p>“Amen to that!” said Harman.</p>

<p>They continued pacing the deck in silence,
till suddenly the testing-room opened and
Wolff appeared.</p>

<p>The black-bearded Wolff was ghastly
white. He had the look of a man who had
received a blow in the stomach. He held up
a finger to the Captain, who came toward him.</p>

<p>“Come in here,” said Wolff.</p>

<p>Shiner was off his stool and sitting on the
couch that ran along the port side of the room.
His hands were in his hair, and the dot of the
mirror galvanometer was spilling from side
to side of the scale unnoticed. Disaster was
in the air.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked the Captain.</p>

<p>“Up!” cried Shiner, coming out of his lair
as one might fancy a cockatrice coming out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
its hole. “Everything is up! Our speculation
is done for! War has been declared.”</p>

<p>“War been declared? What war?”</p>

<p>“England and Germany and France,” replied
Shiner.</p>

<p>“How did you hear it?”</p>

<p>“How did I hear it? Why, the first message
I tapped was a Press Association special
to Sydney. They began cursing me for having
been held up for half an hour while we
were cutting the cable. They thought we
were Sydney. They don’t know the cable is
cut yet. They’re still jabbering. Anyhow,
there it is&mdash;war! And war spells ruin to the
business we were on.”</p>

<p>“We must cut losses,” said Wolff, who was
walking up and down. “The expedition is
off. We must get to a Chile port at once&mdash;Valparaiso
for choice.”</p>

<p>“And my bonus?” said the Captain.</p>

<p>“I guess you may whistle for your bonus,”
said Shiner. “Can’t you see we are bust&mdash;<span class="smcap">B-U-S-T</span>?”</p>

<p>“But we can do one thing,” said Wolff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
“We can hit the cursed English; we can haul
in twenty, forty miles of the cable and cut.
The thing is cut, in any case; but a long break
like that will make it the worse for them; then
Sydney will have one cable the less to talk to
her mother with. Yes, we can do that.”</p>

<p>“Curse them!” said Shiner. “Yes, we can
do that.”</p>

<p>“So my bonus is gone?” said the Captain.
“Well, may I ask one question of you: Who’s
fighting who? Is it France and England
against Germany?”</p>

<p>“It is Germany against France and England,”
said Wolff.</p>

<p>“And you are Germans, and this is a German-owned
vessel?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Wolff. “You have touched
the matter on the head.”</p>

<p>The Captain ruminated.</p>

<p>Then, said he: “Well, gentlemen, this is
a serious matter for me. I lose my bonus, and
I lose my pay, I expect; for if you are as badly
broke as you say, when you land at Valparaiso
or some southern port&mdash;and you daren’t go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
back to Frisco&mdash;there’ll be precious few dibs
to go round unless you manage to sell the old
<em>Penguin</em>, which isn’t very likely in war time.
Well, gentlemen, I’ve thought of a plan by
which I may get my bonus, and my pay, too;
and if you’ll come down to the saloon with
me, I’ll show you it.”</p>

<p>“Why not tell us here?” said Shiner.</p>

<p>“I cannot explain it here. Come down,
gentlemen. When all’s said and done, it won’t
take a minute, and there’s a lot of importance
attaching to what I have to explain to you.
It’s worth a minute.”</p>

<p>He left the testing-room, and they followed
him to the saloon. He led the way into his
cabin, and they followed him like lambs. He
asked them to be seated on the couch opposite
the bunk; then he took the key from the inside
of the door and inserted it in the lock on
the outside.</p>

<p>“What are you doing that for?” said Shiner.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you in one minute,” replied the
Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped swiftly out into the saloon,
banged the door to, and locked it.</p>

<p>It was Shiner who woke to the situation
first, and it was Shiner’s voice that came now
as he clung to the handle of the door and
punctuated his remarks with kicks on the paneling.</p>

<p>The Captain waited a moment till the other
gave pause. Then he said:</p>

<p>“There’s no use in kicking and squealing.
You’re prisoners of war, that’s how you stand.
The ship’s mine now, a lawful prize. What’s
that you say? An Irishman? Of course I’m
an Irishman. What’s that you say? I’m a
traitor to my country? B’gosh, if you say that
again, I’ll open the door and give you a taste
of my quality. Say it again, will you! Say it
again, will you!”</p>

<p>He shook the door handle at each invitation,
but Shiner was dumb. He evidently had no
desire to taste the Captain’s quality. It was
Wolff’s voice that came instead, muted and
murmurous:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Make terms, make terms; there is no use
in arguing. Make terms!”</p>

<p>“You won’t make any terms with me,” said
the Captain, “but you’ll be treated well and
transhipped as quick as possible.”</p>

<p>“But, see here, Captain!” came Shiner’s
voice.</p>

<p>The Captain did not hear him; he had left
the saloon, and next moment was on deck. He
was a man of swift decision, and he had fixed
in his mind that the first thing to be done was
to make the crew his own, and the next to
dump the cable and be gone. He could not
mend it. They had no skilled artificer on
board. To mend it, he would have to bring
both ends on board and connect them. If you
have ever examined a deep-sea cable, with its
water coat of wire, its inner coat of rubber,
and its core, you will quite understand the
complexity of the task.</p>

<p>It was impossible, and he recognized the
fact as he walked forward.</p>

<p>Harman was standing by the dynamometer,
waiting for orders, and the bos’n near Harman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The Captain ordered the bos’n to pipe
the whole crew on deck, and presently, like a
kicked beehive, the fo’c’sle gave up its contents,
the stokers off duty appeared, and even
MacBean himself rose like a seal from the
engine-room hatch.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said the Captain, addressing the
dingy crowd, “is there ever a German among
you?”</p>

<p>Dead silence for a moment, as though the
hands were consulting their own hearts, and
then a voice from back near the starboard alleyway:
“No, there ain’t no Germans here.”</p>

<p>“Sam’s a Dutchman,” came another voice,
and then the voice of Sam, protesting: “You
lie! I vas a New Yorker.”</p>

<p>“Shut your mouths!” said Blood. “I’m an
Englishman, or pretty near the same thing,
and I’m captain of this hooker, which is
owned by a German firm. In other words, it
is owned by Mr. Wolff and Mr. Shiner, who
are Germans. Well, my lads, news has just
come over that cable we have picked up that
war has been declared between England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Germany, so I have taken possession of the
ship in the name of England, d’ye see? Which
means that there’s lots of prize money for all
of us if we can bring her safe into an English
port.”</p>

<p>He waited for a moment after this announcement,
but not a sound came from the
crowd in front of them. It was filtering down
through the thickness of their intelligences.
It was an entirely new proposition that he had
laid before them, and required time to find a
response. They knew&mdash;God help them!&mdash;as
little as he did of the horrible problems of international
and maritime law that the <em>Penguin</em>
was about to wind round herself as the silkworm
winds a cocoon; but they knew the
meaning of the word “money,” and it didn’t
matter to them a rap whether it was prize
money or not, as long as it could be changed
for whisky and tobacco.</p>

<p>A little, wiry Nova Scotian was the first to
respond.</p>

<p>“Go to it!” cried he. “Here’s to England
and a pocketful of money!” He flung up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
cap, and the action touched the rest off. They
cheered&mdash;Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Latins, and
Slavs&mdash;for such was their mixture. All joined
in the shout.</p>

<p>MacBean alone, cautious and cool, made
any question.</p>

<p>“Are you sure,” said he, when the shouting
had ceased, “are you sure we’re in the right
of this? I’m as willin’ as ony man to fight for
England, but I’m no so sure about our poseetion
as regards the ship.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will be soon,” said Blood. “This
is my position: I’m not only going to take the
ship, but I’m going to take anything German
I come across on the high seas. Away back
in the American Spanish War, I put out in a
mud dredger from the Florida coast and took
a mail steamer. We pretended we were a
dynamite boat. There were seven thousand
dollars in gold coin on board her, and we took
it. Never mind where it went to&mdash;&mdash;” A
wild yell from the crowd. “We took it just
as we are going to take any German money
we come across. A chance like this doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
come in most lifetimes, and I’m not going to
lose it.” Applause.</p>

<p>MacBean went back to his engine room.</p>

<p>“May I ax, Captain,” said one of the fellows,
“what’s to become of the owners?”</p>

<p>“Meaning Mr. Wolff and Mr. Shiner?” replied
the Captain. “Why, they are prisoners
of war, and they will be treated as such without
a hair of their heads being touched. But
we can’t keep them on board. We’ll land
them somewhere, or put them on a German
ship, if we find one. Now, then, look lively
and get the cable away. Mr. Harman, get it
aft from the testing-room, and then cast loose
the stoppers; dump both ends.”</p>

<p>He went on the bridge while Harman cast
the cable loose; then he rang up the engines,
and, giving the fellow at the wheel a sou’westerly
course to steer by, put the engine telegraph
to full speed ahead.</p>

<p>He wanted to get away from that spot in a
hurry. He had not yet fixed on any point to
make for&mdash;north, south, east, or west did not
matter for the moment to him. He wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
be somewhere else and to put as many long
leagues as possible between the <em>Penguin</em> and
the scene of her crime.</p>

<p>Harman presently joined him on the bridge.</p>

<p>Said Harman: “Well, this is a rum joke,
ain’t it, Captain? ’Pears to me it’s the rummest
joke ever I seen. We’ve took the ship,
and we’ve took the owners&mdash;and how about
our bonuses and pay?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take the bonuses out of the
first Dutchman we can lay hands on,” said
the Captain. “We’ll never get a cent from
Wolff and Shiner. Their game is up. If I
can lay alongside of a German trader&mdash;and
there are plenty in these waters&mdash;I’ll take all
she’s got.”</p>

<p>“And suppose they show fight?” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Traders don’t fight&mdash;we have eight rifles&mdash;without
ammunition, but that doesn’t matter,
for we’d only be spoofing. The sight of
the rifles is enough. Still, I wouldn’t mind
fighting if we have to.”</p>

<p>“I heard a chap yarning once,” said Harman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
“It was at a meetin’ a fellow give me
a ticket for, and this chap was sayin’ there was
no use in war; he was sayin’ no one was any
the better off for war, and all suchlike. Well,
it ’pears to me it’s a durned good thing, for you
can go and rob the chaps that’s against you,
and it’s all on the square. I’ve all my life been
wantin’ to rob people open,” continued Mr.
Harman, “not poor people, you understand,
for there wouldn’t be no fun in that, and, besides,
they have nothing worth takin’&mdash;but
rich folk. Them’s the chaps. My idea would
be to be goin’ round Nob Hill with a hand
barrow and collecting jewelry, or callin’ at
the Bank of California with a cart and a
shovel. I never expected in my life I’d have
a chance like this.”</p>

<p>“It’s not all too rosy,” said the Captain.
“I’m not clear what a German cruiser could
do to us if they found us skinning a German
ship. I’ve heard that privateering is going to
be allowed in the next war&mdash;which is this&mdash;but
then we haven’t a letter of marque.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“A license to rob. But, license or no license,
we can’t pick and choose. We have to make
good. We’re done out of our bonuses and our
salary. D’ye think I’m going back to Frisco
as poor as I left it, and maybe poorer? For
I’ll tell you one thing, Billy Harman: What
we’ve done to that cable is a penitentiary job
to start with, and if it tricks America any over
this war, supposing she takes a hand in it, it
may mean a hanging job.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d not go on talkin’ like that,”
said Harman. “What on earth’s the use of
going on talkin’ like that? Who’s to catch
us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the Captain. “The
only one thing I do know is the bedrock fact
that our position couldn’t be worse than it is,
and that we may as well play for as big a figure
as possible. Between you and me, it’s just
this&mdash;piracy pure and simple; that’s our game,
under shelter of the pretence that we’re English
and doing all in our power to help our
native land; then if we are caught by an English
ship with our holds full of boodle and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
scuppers full of gold all we have to say is:
‘Please, sir, we have been fighting the Germans
for the good of our native land.’”</p>

<p>“And suppose we are caught by a German
ship?”</p>

<p>“Then it will be all the worse for us; but
come along into the chart room, for I have an
idea, and I want your opinion on it.”</p>

<p>They left the bridge, and went into the chart
room, where the Captain, having closed the
door, brought out a chart of the Pacific, placed
it on the table, and sat down before it.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said he, making a pencil
mark on the spot. “And here,” making another
mark, “lies Christobal.”</p>

<p>“Why, Christoval Island lies in the Solomons,”
said Harman. “I’ve been there.”</p>

<p>“I said Christobal, not Christoval. This is
a German island, and a pretty rich one, too. I
know it, and cause I have to know it, for a
chap there named Sprengel let me down badly
once over a deal. I hope he’s there still. It’s
a rich island, lots of copra and trade. I’m going
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what are you going to do there?”
asked Harman.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said the Captain, “the
place is only just a trading station; it’s not
armed; there are only half a dozen whites,
and&mdash;I’m going to take it.”</p>

<p>“Take it?”</p>

<p>“Hoist the Union Jack there, scoop all the
boodle I can find, up anchor, and bunk for
Valparaiso. That’s my idea.”</p>

<p>“Lord, that would be lovely!” said Harman.
“But suppose they show any sort of fight?”</p>

<p>“Not they. We’ll rig up a dummy gun, and
we can arm a landing party with these blessed
old rifles and cutlasses there. But the dummy
guns will do them. You see, they won’t know
what to make of the cut of the <em>Penguin</em>.
They’ll never have seen a cable ship, most
likely. We’ll tell them we are a volunteer
cruiser. Good name, that.”</p>

<p>A knock came to the door, and the bos’n appeared.</p>

<p>“Please, Captain,” said that individual,
“them guys you’ve locked up in the after cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
are tryin’ to beat the door down and threat’nin’
to fire the ship.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come and attend to them,” said the
Captain grimly. But first he went on the
bridge and gave the helmsman the course for
Christobal.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE CREW’S SHARE OF THE SPOILS</span></h2>


<p>Next day they sighted a bark. She was
English, and, to make up for his disappointment,
the Captain had the pleasure of giving
her news of war, and scaring her nearly to
death with the false news of German cruisers
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The latter trick was played out of spite,
owing to her refusal to relieve him of Wolff
and Shiner&mdash;still in durance vile.</p>

<p>He had brought the <em>Penguin</em> to within
megaphone distance of the bark&mdash;her name
was the <em>Anne Page</em>&mdash;and when he made his
request the answer came roaring back, quite
definite:</p>

<p>“I won’t take no German prisoners. I’m
full up with pigs and copra; there ain’t
standin’ room scarcely as it is, and we’re short
of water and grub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll supply you,” cried the <em>Penguin</em>.
“Lower a boat and you’ll have what you
want.”</p>

<p>The <em>Anne Page</em> seemed to meditate a moment,
and then again came the response like
that of a deaf man who has failed to catch the
meaning of what is said to him:</p>

<p>“I won’t take no German prisoners. There
ain’t no room for them. Why don’t you keep
’em yourself&mdash;you’re big enough?”</p>

<p>On that the Captain gave his news of the
German cruisers, and the <em>Anne Page</em> picked
up her skirts and scuttled.</p>

<p>But next day they had better luck. They
picked up a real German schooner, captained
by a real Simon-pure German skipper, and
eight of the scallawags of the <em>Penguin</em> had
their first exercise under arms.</p>

<p>The <em>Penguin</em> carried a whaleboat for beach
work&mdash;Wolff had strongly resented the purchase
of this boat, but the Captain had stood
firm&mdash;and into it were bundled Wolff and
Shiner, eight malefactors armed with cutlasses
and rifles, followed by Blood himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The schooner&mdash;the <em>Spreewald</em> was her name&mdash;would
have escaped, but there was only a
five-knot breeze blowing, and the <em>Penguin</em>
could make ten. There was also the threat of
ramming. She let herself be boarded, received
the declaration of war, and then submitted
to be robbed.</p>

<p>The whole thing was shameful, and painfully
like robbing a child of the milk it is carrying
home. She was but a little ship, and
the booty was trifling, some five hundred dollars,
some barrels of Bismarck herrings, a
dozen boxes of cigars, and a gold watch and
chain. That is what Blood took from her.
But she relieved him of the presence of Wolff
and Shiner, and he reckoned that equal to a
lot of plunder.</p>

<p>When they steered off they got five miles
away before the <em>Spreewald</em> had fully recovered
her senses from the outrage and pulled
herself together. Then they saw her spreading
her canvas and altering her course.</p>

<p>“She was bound for one of the English
islands, I expect,” said Blood, “and now she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
nosing off for some German port of call.
Well, I guess this is the first blood the English
have drawn in these seas. I deserve a bonus
on that.”</p>

<p>The money he had in his pocket, also the
gold watch and chain; the Bismarck herrings
had gone to the lazaret, and the cigars to the
saloon.</p>

<p>He was turning with Harman to go down
and enjoy one when a little man with a red
head came aft, touching his cap.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said this individual, “I was
sent by the crew to ax what their share in the
liftin’ is to be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you were, were you?” said the Captain.
“And a very natural question, too. I’ll
go forward and have a talk with them.”</p>

<p>He found the men clustered round the picking-up
gear.</p>

<p>“You sent to ask me what your share in the
findings would be,” said he, “so I thought I’d
come and tell you by word of mouth. To begin
with, what do you think yourselves on
board of&mdash;a pirate? You’ll just understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
one thing: this ship is acting on the square;
it’s under command of a Britisher&mdash;that’s me&mdash;and
whatever we take rightfully belongs to
the British government. But I can promise
you this: Your money you signed on for will
be paid when we reach Valparaiso, one-third
of all pickings will be divided among you,
leaving two-thirds for Mr. Harman and me;
and, after we coal at Valparaiso, I intend taking
the hooker down to a port I know of and
selling her. Half the money she brings will
be divided among her crew, the other half
between Mr. Harman and me.”</p>

<p>“And the British government?” asked the
bos’n.</p>

<p>“I’ll settle with the British government,”
replied the Captain, with a wink.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter went up.</p>

<p>The idea of doing the Germans and the
British government at the same time appealed
so much to these gentlemen that they forgot
to consider over the terms for the division of
the spoil or dispute them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“And may I ax are we heading for Valparaiso
now?” asked the red-headed man.</p>

<p>“No, we are not; we are heading for a little
German island named Christobal.”</p>

<p>“And what are we goin’ to do there?” asked
another of the crowd.</p>

<p>“We are going to collect all the money we
can find for the British government.”</p>

<p>Another howl of laughter.</p>

<p>“And suppose, when we’re landed at this
here island, a German ship comes along and
asks us what we are doing?” spoke up a
grumbler. “What’ll us say to that?”</p>

<p>“Why, we’ll say we’re picking mushrooms,”
replied the Captain. “Any more inquiries?
Well, then, you can get to work. See here!
I want half a dozen chaps to help me rig up
a dummy gun on the bow balks. A stovepipe
is good, but we haven’t got one, so we must
just use a big spar sawed down. There’s a
spare yard will do. I’ll go and speak to Mr.
Harman about it.”</p>

<p>He turned off, and in the alleyway he met
MacBean looking more serious and like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Scotch terrier than ever&mdash;an Aberdeen. He
had been listening to every word.</p>

<p>“Mon, mon,” said MacBean, “this is an
awfu’ business. Fiddlin’ with the cable was
bad, but this is shoockin’, rank piracy, call it
what names you will, and that I did not sign
for.”</p>

<p>“What made you sign on at all?” cried the
Captain, flashing out.</p>

<p>“Drink,” replied Mac. “The same that
made Harman and half the crew sign on.
Mon, this is an unholy ship, a drunk ship that
has to keep sober, goin’ about the ocean with
hell in her heart; cable smashin’ and pirating
under the cover of a devastating war&mdash;and sober
all the time.”</p>

<p>“Jolly good job for you all you have to keep
sober.”</p>

<p>“I was not thinkin’ of the goodness or the
badness of the job,” said Mac. “It’s the heepocrisy
gets me.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the Germans don’t get you as well
you’ll be lucky,” replied the other, going aft.</p>

<p>He found Harman in the saloon sampling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the cigars, and he gave him a sketch of what
he had done and said to the crew.</p>

<p>“A lick of grey paint and an artificial bore,
which you can burn out with a hot iron, and
you can’t tell a spar end from the nose of a
four-inch gun,” said he in conclusion.</p>

<p>“From the shore?” said Harman.</p>

<p>“Just so,” replied the Captain. “You didn’t
fancy I was going to invite the blighters
aboard to inspect our armaments, did you?”</p>

<h2>VII<br />
<span class="titlefont">CHRISTOBAL</span></h2>


<p>Christobal Island lay two days’ steaming
away. It was a tiny place set all alone in the
wastes of the sea.</p>

<p>There was only one trading station there,
and it was run by a German on behalf of a
German firm. This person’s name was Sprengel,
and, to use the words that Blood applied
to him some years before the date of this story,
he had everything of the Red Indian about
him except the gentleman.</p>

<p>Sprengel was a Prussian, close-clipped,
clever, hard, and persistent as the east wind
that blows over East Prussia in the spring. He
had managed to keep other traders away from
Christobal Island. Trade was his god; he had
one ideal only&mdash;money, and, with the Teutonic
passion for alien slang, he declared that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Christobal he was the only pebble on the
beach.</p>

<p>The place, though German, was free to all
men, absolutely free, yet Sprengel kept it absolutely
German. No one could compete with
him. Other traders had tried, but their business
had wilted; antagonistic influences had
worked mysteriously against them.</p>

<p>Blood had brought a cargo of trade here
once for a friend. The friend, Samson by
name, had put his all into a little schooner and
a cargo of all sorts of “notions”&mdash;canned salmon,
gin, tobacco, prints, knives, et cetera.
He had taken Blood along as skipper. Bad
luck had followed them to several islands, and
here at Christobal had finished them. Blood
rightly had put down their failure to Sprengel,
and the glorious idea of getting even with
Sprengel now haunted him so that he could
not sleep.</p>

<p>His one dread was that Sprengel, having
made his pile, might have gone back to Bromberg
to enjoy it.</p>

<p>They had finished the “gun” next day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
mounted it on the bow, with a tarpaulin over
the breech as if to protect it from the weather,
when the Captain, who had been superintending
the operations, coming aft, discovered
Harman emerging from the saloon companionway
in a high state of excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ve found it,” said Harman. “I knew it
was there. I guessed the swine couldn’t have
finished the lot, so I set up a hunt for it. Come
you down and see.”</p>

<p>The Captain followed him below, and
there, on the saloon table, he saw standing
three bottles of Pilsener.</p>

<p>“Where did you get those?” said he.</p>

<p>“Get them! I got them out of the locker
in Wolff’s cabin; hid away they were behind
some old newspapers. I guessed the pair of
those chaps hadn’t finished all the lush, and I
hunted and hunted&mdash;first in Shiner’s locker,
then under the mattress in his lower bunk. I
looked into Wolff’s locker twiced, and saw
nothin’ but newspapers, and still I kep’ on. I
reckon I must have smelled the stuff to make
me so persistent. Anyhow, I lit on the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that the stuff might be hid behind the newspapers,
and I went again, and there they
were.”</p>

<p>“Fetch some glasses,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>Harman darted off, and returned with two
glasses and a corkscrew.</p>

<p>The Captain took the corkscrew, placed a
bottle between his knees, and was on the point
of inserting the screw into the cork, when he
paused, stood up, and replaced the bottle and
corkscrew on the table.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“An idea has struck me,” replied the Captain.</p>

<p>“What’s your idea?”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t drink this stuff.”</p>

<p>“Not drink it!” cried the outraged Harman.
“And what on earth do you want it for
if we ain’t to drink it?”</p>

<p>“Bait,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Bait?”</p>

<p>“To catch Sprengel with. This is Lion
brew Pilsener, and it’s a hundred to one, if
he’s still on the island, he hasn’t any of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
stuff with him. There’s no German born could
withstand the temptation. It beats sausages.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harman, flying out like a
child, “if I’d known you was going to collar
the stuff like that I’d have drunk it before I
called you. It ain’t fair. Here am I with my
tongue hangin’ down to my heels for a drink,
and there’s the stuff and the glasses and all.
I’m not given to complain, but it’s too much.
I’m speakin’ my mind now. It’s too much!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you understand that with this stuff
I may be able to get the blighter on board,”
said the Captain, “and if I once get him on
board and down to this saloon the whole of the
rest of the thing will be easy. If we try to
rush the place with him on shore there may
be blood spilled. With him a prisoner here
there won’t be any resistance.</p>

<p>“I’ll take him those three bottles as a present,
and then invite him on board with the
promise of a case of it&mdash;d’ye see?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Harman. “I’ll
split the difference with you. Take him two
bottles as a present, and we’ll drink the other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The Captain considered on this a moment,
and then, fearing mutiny as well as having
a thirst, he gave in.</p>

<p>It was his first drink for a long time, and it
was excellent beer; the only drawback was the
quantity.</p>

<p>“What I can’t see,” said Harman, finishing
his portion of the liquid, “is what in the nation
you want treatin’ the perisher to two bottles
of this stuff; two bottles is too little to take
ashore with you as a present, and it’s one too
many if you’re just going to offer him a drink
after he’s caught.”</p>

<p>The Captain joined issue, and the argument
went on till thirst joined with Harman, and
the Captain gave in. The second bottle was
opened.</p>

<p>And now a strange thing happened. No
sooner had the contents of the second bottle
vanished than the Captain himself prepared
to finish the business.</p>

<p>It was the Irishman coming out.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in one bottle,” said he, “and,
for the matter of that, I can get him aboard on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the promise of beer. How’s he to know there
is none?”</p>

<p>Harman actually protested&mdash;feebly enough,
it is true&mdash;yet he protested, holding out his
glass at the same time. There was a Scotch
strain in Harman.</p>

<p>When they had finished, they filled the bottles
with water and recorked them.</p>

<p>“They’re just as good like that,” said the
Captain, “for Sprengel.”</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
<span class="titlefont">SPRENGEL</span></h2>


<p>At seven o’clock next morning Christobal
showed up on the far horizon, and by ten
o’clock the <em>Penguin</em> was heading for the
anchorage, with the Captain on the bridge and
Harman beside him.</p>

<p>It was a lovely island.</p>

<p>A broken reef protected the beach from the
full force of the sea, and the cliffs showed
green with foliage and flecked at one point by
the eternal smoke of a torrent. Beyond the
beach a white frame house with a veranda
showed, and on either side native houses nestled
among the cocoanut trees and breadfruits.
The faint wind blowing from landward
brought the perfume of vanilla and
flowers, coloured birds flew in the blue sky
above the trees, while the tune of the blue sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
beating on the reef came like the song of sleep
and summer.</p>

<p>A sulphur-tinted butterfly flittered across
the water on the wind, as if to inspect the ship,
and flittered away again. On the beach could
be seen several natives standing and watching
their approach, motionless and seemingly incurious.</p>

<p>“It’s all deep water through the break and
beyond,” said the Captain. “We don’t want
any pilot.”</p>

<p>“There’s a chap come out on the veranda
of the house,” said Harman.</p>

<p>The Captain picked up the glass he had
been using, and turned it on the figure in the
veranda.</p>

<p>“That’s him,” said he. “That’s the chap
right enough. Take a look.”</p>

<p>Harman put the glass to his eye, and the
veranda and the man leaped within ten feet
of him.</p>

<p>The man was short, stout, bull-necked, bullet-headed,
wearing a close, clipped beard and
with his hair cut to the bone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“He ain’t a beauty,” said Harman. “Look,
he’s going into the house, and here he comes
out again.”</p>

<p>Sprengel had brought out a pair of marine
glasses and was observing the ship through
them.</p>

<p>“Wonder if he recognises me,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>Then he stood silent, whistling now and
then, and now and then giving an order to the
fellow at the wheel.</p>

<p>One of the hands was heaving the lead; his
hard, thin voice came up to the bridge in a
snarl:</p>

<p>“Mark four! Mark four! Quarter less
four!”</p>

<p>The Captain rang the engines to half speed,
then to dead slow. The <em>Penguin</em> passed the
opening in the reef. The water she rode on
was like blue satin billowed under by wind;
then, in the glassy smooth beyond, Harman,
who was forward attending to the anchor,
glancing over the side, saw the coral floor beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
them clearly as though he were looking
at it through air.</p>

<p>The Captain rang the engines off, the wheel
flew to starboard, and the rumble-tumble of
the anchor chain through the hawse pipe came
back in moist echoes from the woods and cliffs.</p>

<p>Then, the ship safely berthed, the Captain
had time to turn his attention to the shore.</p>

<p>Sprengel had vanished into the house, and
the few natives on the shore were still standing
about in attitudes of indifference. One had
taken his seat on the sand, and though there
were several canoes on the beach there was
no evidence of any thought of launching them.</p>

<p>“It’s a good job we scoffed that Pilsener,”
said Harman, who had come up on the bridge.
“It wouldn’t have been no use for this chap.
You won’t get this chap on board without a
windlass and a derrick. No, sir! He’s one of
the retirin’ kind. He won’t trade, and he
won’t be civil. I reckon you’d better get that
spar gun trained on the beach and some of our
chaps ready for a landin’ with the rifles, scoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
all the money and valuables we can find, and
cut stick.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking so myself,” said the
Captain. “There’s no use wasting time enticing
this chap on board. Train the gun and
get the landing party ready with rifles and cutlasses.”</p>

<p>He came down from the bridge, and went
aft to his cabin to put on his best coat. When
he came up again the whaleboat was lowered
and the landing party getting into her.</p>

<p>They certainly were a most terrific-looking
lot, and when the boat’s nose touched the sand
and they scrambled out and lined up under
the direction of Harman, the natives looking
on lost their look of indifference, turned, and
bolted for the woods.</p>

<p>“They don’t like the look of us,” said the
Captain. “Now then, you chaps, no chasing
them. You follow after me, and do what Mr.
Harman bids you. Let one man of you disobey
orders and he’ll have to settle with me.”</p>

<p>He produced a navy revolver from his
pocket. It was the only serviceable weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the expedition, barring the cutlasses; they
knew it, and they knew him, and they followed
like lambs as he walked toward the house on
whose veranda Sprengel had reappeared.</p>

<p>Ten yards away he ordered the others to
halt, and advanced alone, putting the revolver
back in his pocket.</p>

<p>Sprengel was in pajamas, and he had been
perspiring with the heat; he was also in a bad
temper and a bit frightened, all of which conditions
did not add to the beauty of his appearance.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sprengel, I believe,” said the Captain,
opening the business.</p>

<p>“That is my name,” replied the other. “And
who are you, may I ask, and what is your ship
doing here and these men?”</p>

<p>“We will go into the house and talk,” said
the Captain, “if you will kindly lead the way.
I am the Captain of a British auxiliary cruiser
come to have a few words with you.”</p>

<p>He followed on the heels of Sprengel, who
evidently had not recognised him in the least,
into a large, airy room floored with native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
matting and furnished with American rockers,
a bamboo couch, a table, and island headdresses
and spears for wall decorations.</p>

<p>“You did not recognise me outside,” said the
Captain. “Perhaps because I had my hat on.
Do you not recognise me now?”</p>

<p>“Not from Adam,” replied Sprengel in a
violent tone. “I only know that you have
landed on my beach with armed men and that
you had but till just now a pistol in your hand.
Also, I recognise that your ship has a gun
trained on my house. Are you aware that this
is a German island?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the point, my dear man,” said
the Captain, taking a seat unasked. “Are you
aware that England is at war with Germany?”</p>

<p>“Eh, what!” said Sprengel, turning more
fully on the other. “What you say? England
at war with Germany!”</p>

<p>“England at war with Germany. Yes.
That is what I said, and I have come to take
your island in the name of the British government.”</p>

<p>Sprengel sat down in a chair and mopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
himself. Sprengel had been practically monarch
of Christobal for a long time.</p>

<p>And now the English had come.</p>

<p>It was an eventuality he had always feared,
always reckoned with. He knew that war was
in the air. He also knew international law,
and he was not so much put out as might have
been expected.</p>

<p>Indeed, he was frankly impudent.</p>

<p>“Well, I did not make the war,” said he.
“I am an honest trader going about my business.
If Christobal is English&mdash;well, it cannot
be helped&mdash;till we take it back from England.
I claim the rights of international law.
My property is sacred.”</p>

<p>“International law, what is that?” asked
Blood.</p>

<p>“Something you would not understand, but
which your peddling government fears <em>and</em> respects.
Something which they would like to
put to one side, <em>but</em> which they cannot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t they? Do you mean to imply
that your property can’t be touched because
of international law?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ab-so-<em>lu</em>tely.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see about that,” said Blood, “for
I’ve come to take away every rag you’ve got
and every penny. I’ll leave you, for you ain’t
very good, and you can keep the house and
the good will of the business, but I want your
money.”</p>

<p>He stood up.</p>

<p>So did Sprengel. Say what we may about
the Prussians, they are certainly plucky
enough.</p>

<p>Threatened with spoliation, all the latent
fury of the man flamed out and centred on
Blood. He stood for a moment visibly swelling;
then he charged.</p>

<p>Had that charge gone home it would have
been the worse for the Captain. Instead of
meeting it, however, he stepped aside; Sprengel
met the wall, nearly bringing the house
down, and Harman, who had been listening
on the veranda, rushed in.</p>

<p>He had brought some signal halyard line
with an eye for eventualities, and they bound
the enemy without much trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Listen to him!” said Harman. “Listen to
him chatterin’ about outrages to noncombatants.
What are ye yourself but an outrage,
you fat Proosian! Capt’in, lend me your
wipe.”</p>

<p>The Captain handed over his handkerchief,
and Harman, with suspicious dexterity, rolled
it into a gag. “That’ll stop your tongue,” said
he. “And now for the plunder.”</p>

<p>They found the safe where the unfortunate
Sprengel kept his money. There were five
thousand dollars there in silver and American
gold coin, and a bank book showing a huge
balance at a Berlin bank. Also securities for
large amounts. They respected these, as they
were useless, and took only the coin.</p>

<p>Then they went over the house and grounds
adjoining, and the total loot tabulated roughly
ran to:</p>

<p>The amount of coin already specified.</p>

<p>Five thousand cigars.</p>

<p>A suit of new pajamas and a safety razor in
case.</p>

<p>A case of Florida water, six bottles of eau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
de Cologne, all the native headdresses adorning
the sitting room.</p>

<p>A live parrot in a cage, half a dozen chickens,
and half a boatload of vegetables.</p>

<p>It was not much, but it was all that they
could lay hands on. Harman wanted to include
a native girl who had come out from
among the trees with a basket of fruit on her
head, not knowing what was going on, but the
Captain vetoed him. He only took the fruit.</p>

<p>Then they pushed off, having first ungagged
their victim, unbound him, and locked him in
the house.</p>

<p>“And the funny thing is,” said the Captain
when they had gained the deck and the boat
was being winched on board, “he never remembered
me, and he doesn’t know yet who
I am.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell him?” said Harman.</p>

<p>“I thought of it, and then I held my tongue.
There might be a chance of him making mischief
when the war is over if he knew my
name.”</p>

<p>“But how in the nation could he make mischief?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
said the simple-minded Harman.
“Germany bust or England bust, it’s all the
same. What you done was in war time, and
so doesn’t count.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” said the Captain.
“I am not at all too sure of that. All that blab
of Sprengel’s about the property of nonbelligerents
may have something in it. I’m not
sure that it mayn’t. It seems to me I’ve heard
something about it before. Blast all nonbelligerents;
there’s always some thorn in the
rose.</p>

<p>“Then, leaving the question of nonbelligerents
aside, we have to think of our own position.
We haven’t a letter of marque, we have
no more right to go hoofing about the seas gobbling
German property than you have to go
down Broadway lifting folk’s watches.”</p>

<p>“Well, what right have we to anything at
all?” cut in the exasperated Harman. “Accordin’
to you, we haven’t the right to breathe
nor live.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way,” said Blood. “We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a perfect right to breathe and live as long as
we can keep our necks out of the noose.”</p>

<p>“D’ye mean to say they’d hang us?”</p>

<p>“It’s highly probable. The Germans
would, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Harman had been attending to the unloading
of the boat all through this talk. He now
went and spat over the side, and then came
back to his companion.</p>

<p>“That’s cheerful,” said he.</p>

<p>“They might give you the choice of shooting
instead of hanging,” went on the Captain.
“For myself, I prefer hanging, I think, if it’s
properly done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, no!” said Harman. “I’ve seen
three fellows hanged, and I’ve swore I would
never get hanged if I could help it. Give me
shootin’, but shootin’ or hangin’ there’s one
thing fixed.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the boodle. I ain’t one of your
clever chaps, and I’ve no education to speak
of, but I’ve noticed in life that the chaps who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
get on are the chaps who get a thing fixed and
stand on it, same as a chap stands on a scaffolding
and builds from it, same as a chap
builds a house and doesn’t care a durn for the
future.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got the boodle fixed,” Mr. Harman
went on, “there’s no use in bothering
whether we’re to be shot or die natural in our
bunks. We’ve gone a certain distance, and
what I says is, now we’ve gone so far let’s go
the whole hog. Let’s rob every one we can lay
hands on. That’s my idea.”</p>

<p>“Germans, you mean?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t particular about Germans,” said
Mr. Harman. “Anything with money to it is
good enough for me, but if it eases your mind
we’ll call ’em Germans.”</p>

<p>The Captain whistled for a moment over
this broad plan. Then he went to superintend
the fellows who were making ready to get the
anchor in.</p>

<p>There were no capstan bars on board the
<em>Penguin</em>; a steam winch did the business. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
gave the signal for steam to be turned on, and
then went up on the bridge.</p>

<p>The rattle and rasp of the winch pawls and
the links of the anchor chain as it was hauled
through the hawse pipe roused echoes from
the shore. The gulls fishing on the little harbour
made by the protecting reef rose, clamouring
and beating their wings, and, as though
the sound of the anchor chain had managed to
free Sprengel, he appeared, having managed
to work his way out of a window.</p>

<p>He came running down to the beach, shaking
his fist and shouting till the Captain, more
for the fun of the thing than any other reason,
picked up a rifle and aimed it at him.</p>

<p>Then he turned and vanished into the
woods.</p>

<p>The slack of the anchor chain was now in,
and now the anchor itself left the water and
was hoisted, dripping, to the catheads. The
Captain rang on the engines, and the <em>Penguin</em>
began to back out. She could have turned,
but it was easier to back her out, especially as
the sea was so smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Outside the reef, as she slued round, she let
go her siren.</p>

<p>Three times its echoes returned from the
moist-throated woods and cliffs; then, full
speed ahead, she went toward the east.</p>

<h2>IX<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE “MINERVA”</span></h2>


<p>Next morning early, Harman, standing on
the bridge by the Captain, pointed to a smudge
on the eastern horizon. The smoke of a
steamer.</p>

<p>The Captain glanced at the spot indicated,
shading his eyes with his hand; then he took
the glass from its sling.</p>

<p>“I can’t make her clearly out,” said he.
“The wind is covering her with her own
smoke.”</p>

<p>“She’s maybe the mail boat that runs to
Samoa,” said Harman, “or maybe she’s just a
tramp. What are you goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“How d’you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean just that. Are we goin’ to let
her slip through our hands?”</p>

<p>“Harman,” said the Captain, “when I
signed on for this cruise I knew I was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in for a shady job; still, there didn’t seem
much to it, anyway. I knew Shiner was going
to tinker up a cable, and I judged he was
clever enough to pull the business through
safely and give us all a big profit. Well, that
scheme is all gone, and now I’m a bloody
pirate, it seems. The war with Germany
started me on the road, and there’s no use in
crying out and saying, or pretending, we’re
privateers. We aren’t; we’re pirates. That’s
the long and the short of it. We aren’t making
war on Germany; we are just collecting
dibbs for ourselves. I’m not proud of it, not
by a long way; but we’re in for it now and may
as well make the most of it. You ask me what
I am going to do with this vessel? Well, I’m
going to go through her.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Harman. “I’m not one for
runnin’ extra risks, but we’ve risked so much
already it’s a pity not to risk a bit more when
we have the chance. For it’s not once in a lifetime
a chance comes to sailormen like this.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it is,” said Blood. “It’s
not every day that chaps like Shiner and Wolff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
fit out a cable-cutting party and get information
of war right first thing through the cut
cable. Ah, the smoke’s clearing and her hull’s
coming out; let’s see what she’s like.”</p>

<p>He put the glass to his eye and examined
the distant ship; then as he looked he began
to whistle.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, taking the glass from his
eye, “I reckon we won’t go through her&mdash;she’s
a man-o’-war.”</p>

<p>“Whatcha say!” cried Harman, seizing the
glass. He looked. Then he said:</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right; she’s a fightin’ ship
sure enough. I guess we’ll let her go this time,
our armaments bein’ so unequal; she’s headin’
right for us, and if you ask for my advice I’d
advise a shift of helm.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Blood, “and don’t you know that
the first thing she’d do if we shifted our helm
without a reason would be to come smelling
round us? Don’t you know that a man-o’-war
has no business to do at all but to look after
other folk’s businesses? She’s not due to time
anywhere; she’s got no cargo to deliver, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
owners to grumble at her if she’s a day late.
No, her business is to keep her eye out on the
watch for shady people like you and me, and
of course for the enemy if it’s war time. No,
I reckon we’ll keep straight on, but there’s
one thing we’ll do, and that is dismantle the
spar gun. I reckon a dummy gun would be a
difficult thing to explain away, and that,
backed by the faces of our chaps and the fact
that we haven’t a yard of cable in our tanks
and no log except the one I faked up and forgot
to keep to date more’n a week ago. Might
get us into very serious trouble.”</p>

<p>“Is she a Britisher, do you think?” asked
Harman, still ogling the approaching vessel
through the glass.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” replied the Captain.</p>

<p>He came down from the bridge, and hustled
the fellows round, making them remove the
dummy gun and place it down below on the
cable deck.</p>

<p>Then he came back on to the bridge.</p>

<p>The stranger had ceased firing up, and had
cleared herself of smoke. She was a cruiser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
right enough, one of the modern, swift, small-tonnage
cruisers that can yet sink you with a
broadside or cripple you most effectually with
a bow chaser and from the distance of four
miles.</p>

<p>Blood laughed as he looked at her.</p>

<p>“I expect she can do her twenty-five knots,”
said he. “Piracy! Who could do anything
with piracy these days between wireless and
things like that. Harman, I guess I’m sick of
this business and the uncertainty of it. I guess
if this chap passes us and leaves us alone I’ll
make tracks for home&mdash;which means Frisco.
We can get rid of the <em>Penguin</em> somehow or
’nother and crawl up home through Central
America. Crawl up home, those are my sentiments
now, for I’ve got a feeling down my
spine that this chap is going to stop and speak
to us.”</p>

<p>“Why should she do that?” said Harman.
“Wish you wouldn’t be <em>drawin’</em> bad luck by
prophesying it. Why in the nation should she
stop a harmless cable ship?”</p>

<p>“Well, if she’s a German she’d stop us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
see if we are English, and then sink us, and if
she’s a Britisher she’d stop us to see if we were
German. I wouldn’t mind in either case only
for the <em>Spreewald</em> and Christobal Island <em>and</em>
Wolff and Shiner. If the Germans were to
take us, and Wolff and Shiner were to get news
of our capture they’d make things pretty warm
for us.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope she’s a Britisher,” said Harman.</p>

<p>A mile off the stranger, who had obviously
slackened speed, ported her helm slightly to
give the <em>Penguin</em> a view of what she was saying.</p>

<p>She was saying, in the language of coloured
flags:</p>

<p>“Lay to till I board you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t ask to be invited,” said Blood.
“Run up the Stars and Stripes&mdash;thank God
she’s English!&mdash;but then we’re German; at
least we’re owned by Wolff and Shiner, and
<em>they’re</em> German as sausages. Of course, they
may have become naturalised Americans, but
a British ship is not likely to go into the family
history of Shiner or Wolff. Down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
you, Harman, anyway, and get the ship’s papers
together and have a box of cigars on the
table for the chap that is sure to come aboard.
And mind, you know nothing; pretend to be
a bit silly, though that doesn’t need much pretence.
Keep your mouth closed and refer
everything to me. I guess this situation will
require some fancy work in the way of lying.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be mum,” said Harman.</p>

<p>He slid down the bridge steps, and scuttered
along the deck to the saloon companionway,
while Blood, alone in his glory on the bridge,
and trying to assume the dignity that he did
not feel, gave his orders to the crew.</p>

<p>He rang the engines to half speed, and then
to dead slow; then he rang them off, and the
<em>Penguin</em>, whose heart had stopped beating, one
might have fancied through fright, lay moving
slightly to the swell and waiting for the
attentions of the <em>Minerva</em>, for that was the
stranger’s name.</p>

<p>She formed a pretty picture across the blue
water despite her ugly colouring and her singular
lines. One knows it to be bad taste to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
praise enthusiastically the new engines of warfare
on land or sea. All the same, a twenty-five-knot
cruiser, with her teeth showing, gives
one a picture of power and speed combined
hard to beat in the present, and perfectly unbeaten
by the past.</p>

<p>Blood was not thinking things like this. He
was taking the measure of the six-inch guns
that seemed straining their long necks to get
at him; also of the little guns that showed their
fangs at all sorts of loopholes and unexpected
places. He had never been so close up to the
business side of a warship in all his sea experience,
and he noticed everything with the freshness
and the vividness and the deep, deep interest
that objects assume for us when they suddenly
become bound up with our most vital interests
and our lives.</p>

<p>I can fancy Charles the First quite disregarding
Bishop Juxon, the crowd, and all the
great considerations that must have crowded
about the scaffold erected in Whitehall; disregarding
all these while he fixed his eyes on
the axe with its handle of good English beachwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and its blade of British iron. That axe
spoke to him if anything ever spoke to him,
and it said, in words as well as deed: I am the
symbol of the British people.</p>

<p>To Blood the <em>Minerva</em> was saying the same
thing.</p>

<p>Blood was a Nationalist&mdash;when he had any
politics at all&mdash;and maintained a sentimental
dislike for Britannia. He really did not dislike
her, but he fancied he did. In reality, he
admired her. He admired her as a lady
whom, to use his own language, you may belt
about the head as much as you like, but who
is sure to give you the knock-out blow in the
long, long end.</p>

<p>The <em>Minerva</em> was one of the things she hit
people with, and the weapon impressed him.
The incongruity of the fact that he had been
robbing Germans in the name of England did
not strike him at all.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of subtleties in the Irish
character that no foreigner, be he Englishman
or German or Frenchman or Scot or Welshman,
can understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Blood, then, though he had been out of Ireland
long enough to lose his brogue almost entirely,
though England had “betrayed his
country in the past,” and had never done much
for him in the present would, had he seen an
English and a German ship in action, have
joined in on the side of England. He had
often abused England, yet at a pinch he would
have fought for her.</p>

<p>That is the Irish attitude, and it is unalterable.
Ireland is, as a matter of fact, bound
to England in wedlock. John Bull married
her forcibly a great many years ago, and
treated her cruelly bad after the marriage.
She is always flinging the fact at his head, and
she will go on doing so till doomsday, but she
is his wife, and no matter what she says she is
always ready, at a pinch, to go for any stranger
that interferes with him.</p>

<p>When Blood declared war against the Germans
he did so in all good faith as an ally of
England. Cold reflection, however, told him
that England would certainly not recognise
that alliance, nor would she recognise the <em>Penguin</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
as one of her fighting ships, official or unofficial,
that with her peculiar ideas as to the
rights of belligerents and nonbelligerents she
might be as bad a party to be captured by as
Germany.</p>

<p>He knew quite well now that between the
<em>Spreewald</em> affair and the Sprengel business, to
say nothing of the original cable-cutting adventure,
he would have an exceedingly bad
time were this cruiser to clap the shackles on
him.</p>

<p>He watched her now as she dropped a boat;
then he leaned over and shouted to Harman,
who had come on deck again, to have the companionway
lowered.</p>

<p>Then, as the boat came alongside, he came
down from the bridge to meet his fate.</p>

<p>A young, fresh-looking individual came up
the steps&mdash;a full lieutenant by his stripes&mdash;saluted
the quarter-deck in a perfunctory manner,
recognised Blood at once as the skipper,
and addressed him without ceremony.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of your ship?” asked the
lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“The <em>Penguin</em>,” replied Blood.</p>

<p>“The deuce it is! Are you sure it’s not the
<em>Sea Horse</em>?”</p>

<p>“The which horse?” inquired Blood, whose
temper was beginning to rise.</p>

<p>It was his first experience of British navy
ways with merchantmen, ways which are usually
decided and heralded by language which
is usually abrupt.</p>

<p>“<em>Sea Horse</em>&mdash;<em>Sea Horse</em>&mdash;ah!” His eye had
fallen on a life buoy stamped with the word
“Penguin.” “You <em>are</em> the <em>Penguin</em>. You will
excuse me, but we were looking after something
like you&mdash;a fifteen-hundred-ton grey-painted
boat. The <em>Sea Horse</em>. Tramp
steamer gone off her head and turned pirate,
looted a German vessel under pretence that
war had broken out between England and
Germany.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t us,” laughed the Captain.
“Couldn’t you see we were a cable ship by the
gear on deck?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the message came to us by wireless
with bare details. What was your last port?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Christobal Island, quite close here&mdash;we
have only left it a few hours, and by the same
token there was news there that war had
broken out between Germany and England.”</p>

<p>“How did they get it?”</p>

<p>“Well, the fellow there&mdash;Sprengel is his
name&mdash;has a wireless installation, and he
picked up a message some days ago.”</p>

<p>“He picked up a lie. It has been all over
the Pacific, seems to me. There’s been a sort
of dust-up over a place called Agadir, but
there’s no small chance of war, worse luck.
The business has been settled. We had the
news only yesterday.”</p>

<p>No news could have been more dumfounding
to the unfortunate Blood than this. The
cable message that had so upset Shiner and
Wolff had been some lying news-agency rumour.
On the strength of it he had done all
he had done. More than that was the mystery
of the <em>Sea Horse</em>. What on earth did it mean?
Had another ship gone pirating on the same
rumour?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He managed, however, to keep a cheerful
countenance and even to speak.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “I’m right glad to hear
that. War may be all right for you, but it’s
no good to our business.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose it is,” said the lieutenant.
“Well, I suppose you are all right, but
just as a matter of form I’ll have a glance at
your log.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Blood, with death in his
heart. “If you’ll come down to the saloon I’ll
have the greatest pleasure in showing it to
you.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant followed him below.</p>

<p>Harman had put out the log and the cigar
box on the saloon table. The lieutenant refused
a cigar, but showed interest at the sight
of the log. He sat down and opened it.</p>

<p>“Why, good heavens,” said he, “you haven’t
been writing it up for days and weeks!
Where’s your first officer’s log?”</p>

<p>“Harman doesn’t keep one,” said Blood,
whose anger was beginning to rise against the
situation and his visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s Harman?” inquired the other, his
eyes running over the entries.</p>

<p>“My first officer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, doesn’t he? H’m&mdash;h’m! Most extraordinary&mdash;what’s
this? ‘Reached the Spot.’
What spot?”</p>

<p>“The spot on the cable we were due to work
on.”</p>

<p>“What cable?”</p>

<p>“You must ask the owners that. It’s private
business.”</p>

<p>“Who are the owners?”</p>

<p>“Shiner &amp; Wolff.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>Blood did not know where the precious pair
might be at that moment, but he answered:</p>

<p>“Frisco.”</p>

<p>“Are they a cable company or simple cable
repairers?”</p>

<p>“Repairers, I think.”</p>

<p>“Where are the rest of the ship’s papers?”</p>

<p>Blood tramped off to his cabin, and returned
with a bundle of all sorts of documents.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I can’t go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
through them now. I must get back and report.
I’ll take these with me for reference.”
He bundled log and papers together and put
them under his arm.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Blood. “Are you taking
those off the ship?”</p>

<p>“Only for reference,” replied the other.
“They will be quite safe, and you can have
them back when I have reported.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Blood.</p>

<p>“And now I’d just like to have a look round.
Follow me, please.”</p>

<p>This was a new departure. A command.
Blood followed, sick at heart, but cigar still
in mouth.</p>

<p>The lieutenant evidently knew all about
cable ships.</p>

<p>He stopped at the after-cable tank.</p>

<p>“Cable tank&mdash;how much have you on
board?”</p>

<p>“Not an inch,” replied Blood.</p>

<p>“H’m! But you want some spare cable for
mending purposes.”</p>

<p>“We used it all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer passed on through the square
where the forward cable tank was situated,
then down to the cable deck.</p>

<p>Here the first thing he spotted was the infernal
spar gun.</p>

<p>He smelled round it, and inquired its use.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Blood. “It was on the
ship when I joined&mdash;some truck left over from
the last voyage, I believe.”</p>

<p>This suddenly recalled the inquisitor to
something he had forgotten&mdash;Blood’s Board of
Trade certificates.</p>

<p>Blood produced them, having to go back to
his own cabin for them. They told their tale
of long unemployment.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was a gentleman, and having
glanced them over returned them without
comment. Then he left the ship with the log
and the papers under his arm, and was rowed
back to the <em>Minerva</em>.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“We are,” said Blood. “There’s no war;
the whole thing was a lying rumour those two
guys sucked in over the cable. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
good chance of war, but it was patched up,
and it’s now peace, perfect peace, with us
perched on top of it like a pair of blame fools.”
He told the whole tale that we know. Then
suddenly light broke upon him.</p>

<p>“The <em>Sea Horse</em>,” said he. “I see the whole
thing now&mdash;when we fired those two blighters
off the ship and shoved them on the <em>Spreewald</em>
it was their interest not to give the show away.
We were nose on to the <em>Spreewald</em>, so she
couldn’t see our name. Shiner and Wolff
would be the last men to give their own
names, considering what they’d been doing and
the latitude they were found in. They’d be
sure to pose as innocents taken off some other
ship by us. They’d fake up a yarn, and they’d
fake up a new name for the old <em>Penguin</em>.”</p>

<p>They had gone on to the bridge again and
they were talking like this with an eye always
upon the <em>Minerva</em>, that arbiter of their destinies.</p>

<p>“That’s easy enough to understand,” said
Harman. “What gets me is how to understand
our position. What the deuce did that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
scuffy want, cartin’ off the log and the ship’s
papers for? Ain’t there no law to protect an
innocent vessel bein’ manhandled by a durned
British cruiser in times of peace? What’s to
become of peaceful tradin’ if such things is allowed?
Where’s the rights of neutrals if a
monkey on a stick like that blue-an’-gold outrage
on the name of a sailor can walk on board
you an’ walk off with the log book in his
pocket? That’s what I want to know. I’m not
a man that wants much in this here world. I
only wants justice.”</p>

<p>“Faith, and I think you are going to get it,”
said the Captain. “Bare justice, as the little
boy’s mother said when she let down his pants.
I’m not saying I didn’t do most of the inciting
to the piracy and plundering, but whether or
no we are all in the soup, and the chap with
the ladle is fishing for us, and there’s no use in
bothering or laying blame&mdash;we’d have shared
equally in the profits.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m makin’ no remarks,” said Harman.
“I’m not the man to fling back at a pal, and I
guess I can take the kicks just the same as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ha’pence, but you’ve a better headpiece than
me, and what I say is, be on the lookout to get
the weather gauge of these jokers so be it’s possible.
You can do it if any man can&mdash;get out
of the soup and be a pineapple.”</p>

<p>“Give us a chance,” said the Captain. “I’m
not going to haul my colours down without a
fight for it.”</p>

<p>They stood watching the <em>Minerva</em>. Men
were cleaning brasswork on board of her, a
squad of sailors were doing Swedish exercises;
the ship’s work was going on as unconcernedly
as though she were lying in harbour, and this
vision of cold method and absolute indifference
to all things but duty and routine did not uplift
the hearts of the gazers.</p>

<p>“They’re stuffed with pride, those chaps,”
said the single-minded Harman. “They potter
about and potter about the seas with their
noses in the air, lookin’ down at the likes of
us who do all the work’s to be done in the
world. And what do they do? Nothin’!
They never carry an ounce of grain or a hoof
or hide, or mend a cable or fetch a letter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
they looks down on us that do as dirt. <em>You</em>
saw that josser in the brass-bound coat and the
way he come aboard&mdash;they’re all alike.”</p>

<p>“She’s moving up to us,” said the Captain,
suddenly changing his position. “She’s going
to speak us.”</p>

<p>The <em>Minerva</em>, with a few languid flaps of
her propeller, was indeed moving up to them.
When she came ranging alongside, within
megaphone distance, a thing&mdash;a midshipman,
Blood said&mdash;speaking through a megaphone
nearly as big as itself addressed the <em>Penguin</em>.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy! You are to follow us down to
Christobal Island.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” said Harman. The Captain
said nothing, merely raising his hand to signify
that he had understood.</p>

<p>“What’s your speed?” came again the voice
through the megaphone.</p>

<p>The Captain seized the bridge megaphone.</p>

<p>“Ten knots,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Right!” came the reply. “Follow us at
full speed.”</p>

<p>The blue water creamed at the <em>Minerva’s</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
forefoot as her speed developed. She drew
away rapidly, and the <em>Penguin</em> slowly and
sulkily began to move, making a huge circle to
starboard.</p>

<p>When she got into line the <em>Minerva</em> was a
good two miles ahead.</p>

<p>Said Harman, for the Captain was speechless:</p>

<p>“I call this playing it pretty low down.
<em>Jumping</em> Jeehoshophat, but we’ll be had before
Sprengel! He won’t rub his hands&mdash;oh,
no! I guess he won’t rub his hands! And the
old <em>Penguin</em> is going as if she liked it. Ain’t
there no gunpowder aboard to blow a hole in
her skin an’ sink her? And that durned British
cruiser as tight fixed to us as though she
was towing us with a forty-foot hawser. I
reckon if I had some poison I’d pour it out and
drink it. I would that! I feel that way low
down I’d pour it out and drink it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>shut</em> your head!” said the Captain.
“You carry on like an old woman with the
stomach ache. We’re caught and we’re being
lugged along by the police officer, and there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
no use in clutching at the railings or making
a disturbance. The one good thing is that we
haven’t any of those chaps on board us, sitting
with fixed bayonets on the saloon hatch and
we in the saloon. The first thing to be done
is to steal as much distance out of her as we
can without her kicking.”</p>

<p>He went to the engine-room speaking tube:</p>

<p>“Below there, heave any muck you think
likely to make smoke in the furnaces; there’s
a lot of old rubber and canvas waste on the
cable deck. I’ll tell Mr. Harman to have it
sent down to you. I want to ’pear as if we
were doin’ more than our best&mdash;yes, we’re
caught and bein’ led to port, and we mean to
have a try to get loose; keep a good head of
steam, and keep your eye on the engine-room
telegraph. I’ll be altering the speed now and
then.”</p>

<p>He sent Harman to do what he said; then
he stood watching the distant <em>Minerva</em>. She
was now about two and a quarter miles ahead.
The two vessels were going at about equal
speed, with the balance perhaps in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the <em>Minerva</em>. He ordered the engines to half
speed, and kept them so for a couple of minutes,
then put them on to full speed again. The
result of this proceeding was an almost imperceptible
gain on the part of the cruiser.</p>

<p>In the next two hours, by the skilful use
of this device, the distance between the two
ships was increased to at least three and a half
miles. Blood was content with that; so gradually
had the increase been made that the
<em>Minerva</em>, suspecting nothing, stood it, but
Blood instinctively felt that she would not
stand any more. The man had a keen psychological
sense.</p>

<p>He was reckoning on a change of weather.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen absolutely dead, and
the heat was terrific, simply because the air
was charged with moisture. The captain knew
these latitudes.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you’re after,” said Harman,
coming up on the bridge. “What’s the
good of stealin’ a few cable len’ths out of her?
We can’t get rid of her by day, for her guns
can hit us at six miles, and if we made a show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to bolt she’d turn and be on us like a cat
pouncin’. She can do twenty-five knots to our
twelve. Then at sundown she’s sure to close
with us and keep us tied tight to her tail.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>He said nothing more.</p>

<p>An hour later he had his reward.</p>

<p>The horizon to westward and beyond the
<em>Minerva</em> had become slightly indistinct; the
horizon to eastward and behind them was still
brilliant and hard.</p>

<p>He knew what was happening. A slight
change of temperature was stealing from the
west, precipitating the moisture as it came in
the form of haze.</p>

<p>He put his hand on the lever of the telegraph
and rang the engines off.</p>

<p>Harman said nothing. He went to the side
and spat into the sea. Then he came back and
stood watching.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like haze to knock gun
firing on the head,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>Harman said nothing, but moistened his
lips. A minute passed, and then the <em>Minerva</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
all at once, like a person showing the faintest
sign of indecision, showed the faintest change
in definition. The faint haze had touched her.</p>

<p>At the same moment the Captain rang up
the engines, and ordered the helm to be put
hard astarboard. The <em>Penguin</em> forged ahead,
and began to turn.</p>

<p>“They’re so busy cleaning brasswork and
saluting each other that they haven’t noticed
Mr. Haze,” said the Captain. “They’re new
to this station and don’t know that Mr. Fog is
sure coming on her heels. Ah, she’s seen us,
and she’s turning.”</p>

<p>The <em>Minerva</em>, in fact, had also put her helm
hard astarboard.</p>

<p>She was making a half circle, and as small
a half circle as she possibly could, but the <em>Penguin</em>
had got a quarter circle start on her, and
while the <em>Minerva</em> was still going about the
<em>Penguin</em> was off.</p>

<p>If hares ever chased ducks this business
might be compared to a lame duck being
chased by a hare. The <em>Minerva</em> could steam
ten miles to the <em>Penguin’s</em> five and over; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
guns even now could have sunk the <em>Penguin</em>
with ease, though they might not have made
very good shooting, owing to the haze; that
elusive, delusive haze.</p>

<p>“Below there,” cried the Captain through
the engine-room speaking tube. “Shake yourself
up, MacBean! Whack the engines up&mdash;give
us fifteen or burst! What’s the matter?
We’re being chased by that British cruiser,
and it’s the penitentiary for the lot of us if
we’re caught&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>He turned, and at that moment the <em>Minerva</em>
spoke.</p>

<p>A plume of smoke showed at her bow, there
came a shrill, long-drawn “whoo-oooo” like a
hysterical woman “going off” somewhere in
the sky, then a jet of spume and a lather of
foam in the sea two cable lengths to port.</p>

<p>It was a practice shell, and it left the water
and made another plume a mile and a half
ahead and yet another a mile beyond that.</p>

<p>It was her first and last useful word, for
now the haze had her, destroying her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
war purposes as efficiently as a bursting shell
in her magazine.</p>

<p>The haze had also taken the <em>Penguin</em>;
everything seemed clear all around, but all
distant things had nearly vanished.</p>

<p>Another shell came whooing and whining
from the spectred <em>Minerva</em> before the white
Pacific fog blotted her out.</p>

<p>A faint wind was bringing it, less a wind
than a travelling chillness, a fall of temperature,
moving from east to west.</p>

<p>The Captain, having given his instructions
to the helmsman, left the bridge, and went
down below.</p>

<h2>X<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE LAST OF THE “PENGUIN”</span></h2>


<p>South of Chiloe Island, on the Chile coast,
there lies a little harbour which shall be nameless.</p>

<p>Here, six days later, the <em>Penguin</em> was hurriedly
coaling&mdash;on the <em>Spreewald’s</em> dollars.</p>

<p>It was at eight o’clock on a glorious and
summerlike morning that she put out of this
place with her bunkers only half full, her
stores just rushed aboard cumbering the deck,
and a man swung over the stern on a board,
painting her name out above the thunder and
pow-wow of the screw.</p>

<p>Blood would never have wasted paint and
time in the attempt to alter the name of his
ship had it been the English he dreaded now.
As a matter of fact, word had come to the chief
official at the little nameless port above indicated
that the Germans were out looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a fifteen-hundred-ton cable boat named the
<em>Penguin</em>, grey-painted and captained by a
master mariner named Michael Blood.</p>

<p>The bleating of the infernal <em>Spreewald</em> had
been heard all over the Pacific. Sprengel’s
bad language was following it. The <em>Minerva</em>
had communicated by wireless with the German
gunboat <em>Blitz</em>, lying at the German island
of Savaii, in the Navigators. The <em>Blitz</em> had
spoken to the cruiser <em>Homburg</em>, lying at
Tongatabu; from Tongatabu it had been
flashed to Fiji, and from there to Sydney.
From Sydney it went to San Francisco, reaching
the City of the Golden Gate in time for
the morning newspapers; from there it passed
in dots and dashes down the west American
seaboard to Valparaiso and Valdivia.</p>

<p>Added to all the turmoil, the cable company
whose cable had been broken smelled the truth
and were howling for the <em>Penguin’s</em> blood.</p>

<p>Marconi waves from Valparaiso had found
the German cruiser squadron far at sea, and
they had started on the hunt.</p>

<p>This was the news that had come to the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
official at the little Chilean port, and which,
being friendly toward Blood and unfriendly
toward Germany, he communicated to the
former. There was also the matter of a tip,
which left the coffers of the <em>Penguin</em> completely
empty after the account for coal, provisions,
and harbour dues had also been settled.</p>

<p>“What’s the course?” asked Harman as the
coast line faded behind them.</p>

<p>“Straight out to sea,” replied Blood. “Due
west till we cut the track from Taliti to the
Horn; then southeast for the Straits of Magellan.
Ramirez is going to fake them with
the news that we have gone north.”</p>

<p>“Why not go straight for the Straits down
the coast instead of puttin’ out like this?”</p>

<p>“They’ll be hunting the coast; sure to send
a ship south. They’ll never think of us going
west; the last thing they’d think of.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure Ramirez is safe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s safe enough. He hates the Germans,
and he has taken my money. He’ll stick
to his bargain. I wish we were as safe. Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Lord, every cent gone and nothing to show for
it but this old hooker which we can’t sell, and
the sure and certain prospect of the penitentiary
if we don’t work a miracle&mdash;and even
then we are lost dogs. Frisco is closed to us.
We never can show our noses in Frisco again.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have come on this cruise if I’d
known things was goin’ to pan out like this,”
said the ingenuous Harman. “No, indeedy!
I’d have stuck to somethin’ more honest. What
I want to know is this: What’s the use of war,
anyway? When it has a chance of doin’ a man
a good turn the blighted thing holds off,
whereas if you and me had been runnin’ a
peace concern it’s chances that it’d have come
on. No, blamed if I don’t turn a Methodis’
passon if I ever get out o’ this benighted job.
It’s crool hard to be choused like this by a cus’t
underhand trick served on one just as a chance
turns up to make a bit. Why couldn’t they
have fought and been done with it? What’s
the good of all them guns and cannons, and
all them ships? What in the nation’s the good
of them ships? Seems to me the only good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
them is to go snuffin’ and smellin’ round the
seas, pokin’ their guns into other folk’s affairs
and spoilin’ their jobs. Well, there’s an end
of it. I’m a peace party man now and forever
more. Blest if it ain’t enough to make a man
turn a Bible Christian!”</p>

<p>“You’d better go and see to the stowing of
the stores,” said the Captain. “There’s no use
in carrying on like that. I didn’t make war,
or else I guess I’d have made it more limber
on its legs. Come! Hurry up!”</p>

<p>They stood two days to the west, and then
they turned to the south coast and made their
dash for the Straits.</p>

<p>The weather had changed. It was steadily
blowing up from the westward. The sea, under
a dull sky, had turned to the colour of lead,
and the heavy swell told of what was coming.</p>

<p>They had not sighted a ship since leaving
the Chilean coast, but three days after altering
their course the smoke of a steamer appeared,
blown high by the wind and far to westward.
The wind had scarcely increased in force, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the sea was tremendous and spoke of what was
coming.</p>

<p>The Captain, on the bridge, stood with a
glass to his eye, trying to make out the stranger.
He succeeded, and then, without comment,
handed the glass to Harman.</p>

<p>Harman, steadying himself against the rolling
and pitching of the ship, looked.</p>

<p>A waste of tempestuous water leaped at him
through the glass, and then, bursting a wave
top to foam with her bows, grey as the seas she
rode came a ship of war.</p>

<p>A cruiser, with guns nosing at the sky as if
sniffing after the traces of the <em>Penguin</em>. She was
coming bow on, and now, falling a point
or two, her fore funnel seemed to broaden out
and break up. It was the three funnels showing,
now <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> and now individually.
Then, as she came to again, the three funnels
became one.</p>

<p>“She’s a three-funnel German,” said Harman,
“and she has spotted us.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the wind suddenly increased
in violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not bothering about her much,” said
the Captain. “I’m bothering about what’s in
front of us.”</p>

<p>“Whacher mean?”</p>

<p>“Mean! Look at the sea and the stuff that’s
coming. Could we put the ship about in this
sea? No, we couldn’t. You know very well
the old rolling log would turn turtle. Well,
what’s before us? A lee shore. If we don’t
reach the opening of the Straits of Magellan
before sundown we’re dead men all. Germans!
I wish I were safe in the hold of a good
German ship.”</p>

<p>The truth of his words burst upon Harman.
There are no lights at the entrance of the Magellan
Straits; the entrance is not broad; to hit
it in the darkness would be next door to impossible,
and not to hit it would be certain
death.</p>

<p>It was impossible to put the ship about.
Harman’s extraordinary mind did not seem
much upset at the discovery.</p>

<p>“D’ye think we’ll do it?” asked he.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the Captain. “We may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and we mayn’t. You see, we haven’t a patent
log. I haven’t had a sight of the sun for two
days. I can’t figure things to a nicety. But
if I had ten patent logs I wouldn’t use them
now. I’d be afraid to&mdash;what would be the
good? Mac is whacking up the engines for
all they’re worth.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we’ll do it,” said Harman,
applying his eye again to the glass. Then:
“She’s going about.”</p>

<p>The Captain took the glass.</p>

<p>The cruiser was turning from her prey before
it was too late. It was a terrific spectacle,
and once the Captain thought she was gone.
The foam was bursting as high as her fighting
tops and the grey water pouring in tons over
her decks.</p>

<p>Yet she did it, and the last Blood saw of
her was the kick of her propellers through
sheets of foam.</p>

<p>At four o’clock that day they knew that they
could not do it. There was no grog on board,
so they were having a cup of tea in the saloon.
The Captain sat at the head of the table, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the tin teapot and a plate of fancy biscuits.</p>

<p>The Captain and Harman were the only
two men on board with a knowledge of what
was coming.</p>

<p>“Another lump of sugar in mine,” said Harman.
“I don’t hold with tea; I never did hold
with tea. The only thing that can be said for
it is it’s a drink. And how some of them
blighters ashore lives suckin’ it day and night
gets me.”</p>

<p>He was drinking out of his saucer.</p>

<p>“Oh, tea’s all right. I reckon tea’s all
right,” said the Captain in an absent-minded
manner.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is, but give me a hot whisky and
you may take your tea to them that like it,”
replied Harman.</p>

<p>He lit his pipe and went on deck. The Captain
followed. They could not keep away
from the fascination up above.</p>

<p>The bos’n was on the bridge, and they relieved
him.</p>

<p>Not a sign of land was in sight, and the sea
was running higher than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see,” said the Captain, “we can’t make
it. It’ll be sundown in an hour. We’ll strike
the coast some time after dark, and God have
mercy on our souls.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t tellin’ the hands?” said Harman.</p>

<p>“No use tellin’ them. I told Mac, so that
he might get the best out of the engines.”</p>

<p>“And there’s no bit of use gettin’ out life
belts,” said Harman. “I know this coast;
rocks as big as churches an’ cliffs that nuthin’
but flies could crawl up; and b’sides which if
a chap found himself ashore he’d either starve
or be et by niggers. They’re the curiosest
chaps, those blighters down here. I guess the
A’mighty spoiled them in the bakin’ and
shoved them down here by the Horn to hide
them from sight. Wonder what Wolff and
Shiner is doin’ by this?”</p>

<p>“God knows!” said the Captain.</p>

<p>The darkness fell without a sight of the
land, and, leaving the bos’n on the bridge, they
came down for a while to the engineroom for
a warm. Mac just inquired if there was any
sight of land, and said nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The engines were no longer being pressed,
and they smoked and watched the projection
and retraction of the piston rods, the revolution
of the cranks, and all the labours of this
mighty organism so soon to be pounded and
ground to death on the hard rocks ahead.</p>

<p>It was toward midnight that the coast spoke,
so that all men could hear on board the <em>Penguin</em>.</p>

<p>Its voice came through the yelling blackness
of the night like the roar of a railway
train in the distance.</p>

<p>The crew were gathered aft and in the alleyways,
for all forward of the bridge the
decks were swept. Harman and the Captain
were on the bridge.</p>

<p>Mac had the word to give her every ounce
of steam he could get out of the boilers, in
the desperate idea that the harder she was
pressed the higher she might be driven on the
rocks, and the tighter she might stick.</p>

<p>The roaring of the breakers seemed now
all around them, and the Captain and Harman
were clinging to the bridge rails, bracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
themselves for the coming shock, when&mdash;just
as a curtain is drawn aside in a theatre&mdash;the
rushing clouds drew away from the moon.</p>

<p>The white, placid full moon whose light
showed the foam-dashed coast to either side
of them, and right ahead clear water.</p>

<p>They had struck the Magellan Straits by
some miracle, just as the bullet strikes the
bull’s-eye of a target, and right to port they
saw a great white ghost rising in the moonlight
and falling again to the sea.</p>

<p>It was the foam breaking on the Westminster
Hall.</p>

<p>It was breaking three hundred feet high,
and Harman, as he was hurled along to the
safety of the Straits, caught a glimpse of the
great rock itself after a wave had fallen from
it, glistening in the moonlight desolately, as
slated roofs glisten after rain.</p>

<p>That was a sight which no man, having
once seen, could ever forget.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I met Blood last year. He was exceedingly
prosperous, or seemed so. He told me this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
story, and I have so mixed names and places
that he himself would scarcely recognise the
chief actor, much less his enemies. As to the
fate of the <em>Penguin</em>, I could only get him to
say that she “went down” somewhere south of
Rio, but that all hands were saved. Harman,
he said, had turned religious.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">I<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE CAPTAIN GETS A SHIP</span></h2>


<p>After the <em>Penguin</em> job, Captain Blood and
Billy Harman, that simple sailorman, had
come back to Frisco, the very port of all others
one might fancy they would have avoided,
but Billy had been a power in Frisco, and,
reckoning on his power, he had taken the Captain
back with him.</p>

<p>“There’s no call to be afraid,” said Billy;
“there was more in that job than the likes of
us. Why, they’d pay us money to tuck us
away. Whatser use freezin’ round N’ York
or Boston? There’s nothin’ to be done on the
Eastern side. Frisco’s warm.”</p>

<p>“Damn warm!” put in the Captain.</p>

<p>“Maybe; but there’s ropes there I can pull
an’ make bells ring. Clancy and Rafferty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
all that crowd are with me, and we’ve done
nothin’. Why, we’re plaster saints to the
chaps that are walkin’ round in Frisco with
cable watch chains across their weskits.”</p>

<p>They came back, and Billy Harman proved
to be right. No one molested them. San
Francisco was heaving in the throes of an election,
and people had no time to bother about
such small fry as the Captain and his companion,
while, owing to the good offices of the
Clancys and Raffertys, Billy managed to pick
up a little money here and there and to assist
his friend in doing likewise.</p>

<p>Then things began to get slack, and to-day,
as bright a morning as ever broke on the Pacific
coast, the Captain, down on his luck and
without even the price of a drink, was hanging
about a wharf near the China docks waiting
for his companion.</p>

<p>He took his seat on a mooring bitt, and,
lighting a pipe, began to review the situation.
Gulls were flitting across the blue water,
whipped by the westerly wind blowing in
from the Golden Gate, a Chinese shrimp boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with huge lugsail bellying to the breeze was
blundering along for the upper bay, crossing
the bows of a Stockton river boat and threatening
it with destruction; pleasure yachts,
burly tugs, and a great four-master just coming
in with the salt of Cape Horn on her sun-blistered
sides&mdash;all these made a picture
bright and moving as the morning.</p>

<p>It depressed the Captain.</p>

<p>Business and pleasure have little appeal to a
man who has no business and no money for
pleasure. We all have our haunting terrors,
and the Captain, who feared nothing
in an ordinary way, had his. When
in extremely low water, he was always
haunted by the dread of dying without
a penny in his pocket. To be found
dead with empty pockets was the last indignity.
His Irish pride revolted at the thought,
and he was turning it over in his mind now
as he sat watching the shipping.</p>

<p>Then he caught a glimpse of a figure advancing
toward him along the quay side.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Harman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“So there you are,” said he, as he drew up
to the Captain. “I been lookin’ for you all
along the wharf.”</p>

<p>“Any news?” asked the Captain.</p>

<p>Mr. Harman took a pipe from his pocket,
and explored the empty bowl with his little
finger; then, leaning against the mooring bitt,
he cut some tobacco up, filled the pipe, and lit
it. Only when the pipe was alight did he seem
to hear the Captain’s question.</p>

<p>“That depends,” said he. “I don’t know
how you’re feelin’, but my feelin’ is to get out
of here, and get out quick.”</p>

<p>“There’s not much news in that,” said
Blood. “I’ve had it in my head for days.
What’s the use of talking? There’s only one
way out of Frisco for you or me, and that’s by
way of a fo’c’s’le, and that’s a way I’m not going
to take.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Harman, “you’ll let me say
my say before putting your hoof in my mouth.
News&mdash;I should think I had news. Now, by
any chance did you ever sight the Channel
Islands down the coast there lying off Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Barbara? First you come to the San Lucas
Islands, then you come to Santa Catalina, a
big brute of an island she is, same longitude as
Los Angeles; then away out from Santa Catalina
you have San Nicolas.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve never struck them,” replied
Blood. “What’s the matter with them?”</p>

<p>“The Chinese go there huntin’ for abalone
shells,” went on Harman, disregarding the
question. “I’m aimin’ at a teeny yellow bit of
an island away to the north of the San Lucas,
a place you could cover with your hat, a place
no one ever goes to.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s twenty thousand dollars in
gold coin lyin’ there ready to be took away.
Only this morning news came in that one of
the See-Yup-See liners&mdash;you know them rotten
old tubs, China owned, out of Canton, in
the chow an’ coffin trade&mdash;well, one of them
things is gone ashore on San Juan, that’s the
name of the island. Swept clean, she was, and
hove on the rocks, and every man drowned
but two Chinee who got away on a raf’. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the news from Clancy. The wreck’s to be
sold, and Clancy says the opinion is she’s not
worth two dollars, seein’ the chances are the
sea’s broke her up by this. Well, now look
here, I know San Juan, intimate, and I know a
vessel, once ashore there, won’t break up to the
sea in a hurry by the nature of the coast.
There’s some coasts will spew a wreck off in
ten minutes, and some’ll stick to their goods
till there’s nuthin’ left but the starnpost and
the ribs. It’s shelvin’ water there and rocks
that hold like shark’s teeth. The <em>Yan-Shan</em>&mdash;that’s
her name&mdash;will hold till the last trumpet
if she’s hove up proper, which, by all accounts,
she is, and there’s twenty thousand dollars
aboard her.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Blood.</p>

<p>“Well, if we could crawl down there&mdash;you
an’ me&mdash;we’d put our claws on that twenty
thousand.”</p>

<p>“How in the nation are you going to rig out
a wrecking expedition on two cents, and suppose
you could buy the wreck for two dollars&mdash;where’s
your two dollars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not goin’ to buy no wrecks,” replied
Harman, “nor fit out no wreckin’ expeditions.
What I want is something small and easy handled&mdash;no
steam, get her out and blow down on
the northwest trades, raise San Juan and the
<em>Yan-Shan</em>, lift the dollars, and blow off with
them. Why, it’s as easy as walkin’ about in
your slippers!”</p>

<p>The Captain sighed.</p>

<p>“As easy as getting into the penitentiary,”
said he. “First of all, you’d have to steal a
boat, and Frisco is no port to steal boats in;
second, there’s such things as telegraphs and
cables. You ought to know that after the <em>Penguin</em>
job. Then if we were caught, as we
would be, you’d have the old <em>Penguin</em> rising
like a hurricane on us. She’s forgotten now, I
know, but once a chap gets in trouble everything
that’s forgotten wakes up and shouts.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Harman, “and maybe I’d be
such a fool as to go stealin’ boats. I’m not
goin’ to steal no boats. But I’m goin’ to do
this thing <em>somehow</em>, and once I set my mind
on a job I does it. You mark me. I’m fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
drove crazy to get out of here and be after
somethin’ with money on the end of it, and
once I’m like that and sets my think tank
boilin’, there’s fish to fry. You leave it to me.
I ain’t no fool to be gettin’ into penitentiaries.
Well, let’s get a move on; there’s nothin’ like
movin’ about to keep one’s ideas jumpin’.”</p>

<p>They walked along the wharf, stepping
over mooring hawsers, and pausing now and
then to inspect the shipping. There is no port
in the world to equal San Francisco in variety
and charm. Here, above all other places, the
truth is borne in on one that trade, that much
abused and seemingly prosaic word, is in
reality another name for romance. Here at
Frisco all the winds of the world blow in ships
whose voyages are stories. Freighters with
China mud still clinging to their anchor flukes,
junks calling up the lights and gongs of the
Canton River, schooners from the islands,
whalers from the sulphur-bottom grounds,
grain ships from half the world away, the
spirit of trade hauls them all in through the
Golden Gate, and, over and beyond these, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
bay itself has its romance in the ships that
never leave it&mdash;junks and shrimp boats, the
boats of Greek fishermen, yachts, and all sorts
of steam craft engaged on a hundred businesses
from Suisun Bay to the Guadeloupe
River.</p>

<p>Wandering along, Blood and his companion
came to Rafferty’s Wharf. Rafferty’s Wharf
is a bit of the past, a mooring place for old
ships condemned and waiting the breaking
yards. It has escaped harbour boards and fires
and earthquakes, healthy trade never comes
there, and very strange deals have been completed
in its dubious precincts over ships
passed as seaworthy yet held together, as Harman
was explaining now to Blood, “by the
pitch in their seams mostly.”</p>

<p>As they came along a man who was crossing
the gangway from the tank saw Harman
and hailed him.</p>

<p>“It’s Jack Bone,” said Harman to Blood.
“Walk along and I’ll meet you in a minute.”</p>

<p>Blood did as he was directed, and Harman
halted at the gangway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re the man I want,” said Bone.
“Who’s your friend?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a chap,” replied Harman.
“What’s up now?”</p>

<p>Bone took him by the arm, and led him
along in an opposite direction to that in which
Blood was going. Bone was the landlord of
the Fore and Aft Tavern, half tavern, half
sailors’ boarding house, situated right on Rafferty’s
Wharf and with a stairway down to
the water from the back premises. His face,
to use Harman’s description of it, was one
grog blossom, and what he did not know of
wicked wharfside ways could scarcely be
called knowledge.</p>

<p>“Ginnell is layin’ about, lookin’ for two
hands,” said Bone. “He’s due out this evenin’,
and it’s five dollars apiece for you if you can
lay your claws on what he wants. Whites,
they must be whites; you know Ginnell.”</p>

<p>Harman did.</p>

<p>Ginnell owned a fifty-foot schooner engaged
sometimes in the shark-fishing trade, sometimes
in other businesses of a more shady description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
He had a Chinese crew, and,
though the customhouse laws of San Francisco
demanded only one white officer on a Chinese-manned
boat, Ginnell always made a point of
carrying two men of his own colour with him.</p>

<p>Being known as a hard man all along the
wharfside, he sometimes found a difficulty in
supplying himself with hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know Ginnell,” replied Harman.
“Him and his old shark boat by repitation.
I’ve stood near the chap in bars now and
again, but I don’t call to mind speakin’ to him.
His repitation is pretty noisy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help that,” said Bone. “I
didn’t make the chap nor his repitation; if he
had a better one, I guess ten dollars wouldn’t
be lyin’ your way.”</p>

<p>“Nor twenty dollars yours,” laughed Harman.</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” said Bone. “The
question is, do you take on the job? I’d do it
all myself only there’s such a want of sailormen
on the front. It’s those durned Bands of
Hope and Sailors’ Rests that sucks ’em in, fills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
’em with bilge in the way of tracks and ginger
beer, and turns ’em out onfit for any job onless
it’s got a silver-plated handle to it. Mouth
organs an’ the New Jerusalem is all they cares
for onct them wharf missionaries gets a holt
on them. I tell you, Billy Harman, if they
don’t get up some by-law to stop these chaps
propagatin’ their gospels and spoilin’ trade,
the likes of me and you will be ruined&mdash;that’s
a fac’. Well, what do you say?”</p>

<p>All the time Mr. Bone was holding forth,
Harman, who had struck an idea, was deep in
meditation. The question roused him.</p>

<p>“If Ginnell wants two chaps,” said he, “I
believe I can fit him with them. Anyhow,
where’s he to be found?”</p>

<p>“He’ll be at my place at three o’clock,” said
Bone, “and I’ve promised to find the goods
for him by that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Harman, “I’ll
find the chaps and have them at your place
haff past three or so; you can leave it safe in
my hands.”</p>

<p>“You speak as if you was certain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“And certain I am. I’ve got the chaps you
want.”</p>

<p>“Now look here,” said Bone, “don’t you
take on the job unless you’re more than sure.
Ginnell isn’t no boob to play up and down
with; he’d set in, mostlike, to wreck the bar if
he thought I was playin’ cross with him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret,” said Harman. “I’ll be there,
and now fork out a dollar advance, for I’ll
have some treatin’ to do.”</p>

<p>Bone produced the money. It changed
hands, and he departed, while Harman pursued
his way along the wharf toward his
friend.</p>

<p>Blood was sitting on an empty crate.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, as the other drew up, “what
business?”</p>

<p>Harman told every word of his conversation
with Bone, and, without any addition to
it, waited for the other to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got the dollar,” said Blood
at last, “and there’s some satisfaction in that.
I’m not the chap to take five cents off a chap
by false pretenses same’s you’ve done with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Bone, but Bone’s not a man by all accounts;
he’s a crimp in man’s clothes, and if all the old
whalemen he’s filled with balloon juice and
sent to perdition could rise up and shout, I
reckon his name’d be known in two hemispheres.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Harman. “What
was that you were saying about false pretenses?
I haven’t used no false pretenses.
They ain’t things I’m in the habit of usin’ between
man and man.”</p>

<p>“Well, what have you been using? You
told me a moment ago you’d agreed to furnish
two hands to this chap’s order for five dollars
apiece and a dollar advance.”</p>

<p>“So I have.”</p>

<p>“And where’s your hands?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them.”</p>

<p>“In your pocket?”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up!” said Harman. “I never did
see such a chap as you for wearin’ blinkers;
can’t you see the end of your nose in front of
you? Well, if you can’t, I can. However, I’ll
tell you the whole of the business later when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
I’ve turned it round some more in my head.
What I’m after now is grub. Here’s a dollar,
and I’m off to Billy Sheehan’s; you come
along with me&mdash;a dollar’s enough for two&mdash;and
you can raise your objections after you’ve
got a beefsteak inside of you. Maybe you’ll
see clearer then.”</p>

<p>The Captain said no more, but followed
Harman. Far better educated than the latter,
he had come to recognise that Harman,
despite his real and childlike simplicity in
various ways, had a mind quicker than most
men’s. He would often have gone without a
meal during that wandering partnership
which had lasted for nearly a year but for
Harman’s ingenuity and power of resource.</p>

<p>At Sheehan’s they had good beefsteak and
real coffee.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Harman, when they had finished,
“if you’re ready to listen to reason, I’ll
tell you the lay I’m on. Ginnell wants two
hands. I’m goin’ to offer myself for one, and
you are goin’ to be the other.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Blood. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
mean to say I’m to sign on in that chap’s shark
boat. Is that your meaning?”</p>

<p>“I said nuthin’ about signin’ on in shark
boats. I said we two has got to get out of here
in Ginnell’s tub. Once outside the Gate we’re
all right.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Blood. “We’re to scupper
Ginnell and take the boat&mdash;and how about the
penitentiary?”</p>

<p>“I’m blest if you haven’t got penitentiaries
on the brain,” said Harman. “If you leave
this thing to me, I’ll fix it so that there’ll be
no penitentiaries in the business. Of course if
we were to go into such a fool’s job as you’re
thinkin’ about, we’d lay ourselves under the
law right smart. No, the game I’m after is
deeper than that, and it’s Ginnell I’m goin’ to
lay under the law. Now I’ve got to run about
and do things an’ see people. I’ll leave you
here, and here’s a quarter, and don’t you spend
it till the time comes. Now you listen to me.
Wait about till haff past three, and at haff past
three punctual you turn into the Fore and Aft
and walk up to the bar and lay your quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
down and call for a drink. You’ll see me
there, and if I nod to you, you just nod to me.
Then I’ll have a word in private with you.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” said the Captain.</p>

<p>“That’s all for the present,” said Harman,
rising up. “You’ll be there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be there,” said Blood, “though I’m
blest if I can see your meaning.”</p>

<p>“You will soon,” replied the other, and,
paying the score, off he went.</p>

<p>He turned from the wharves up an alley,
and then into a fairly respectable street of
small houses. Pausing before one of these, he
knocked at the door, which was opened almost
immediately by a big, blue-eyed, sun-burned,
good-natured-looking man some thirty
years of age and attired as to the upper part of
him in a blue woollen jersey.</p>

<p>This was Captain Mike, of the Fish Patrol.</p>

<p>“Billy Harman!” said Captain Mike.
“Come in.”</p>

<p>“No time,” said Harman. “I’ve just called
to say a word. I wants you to do me a favour.”</p>

<p>“And what’s the favour?” asked the Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothin’ much. D’you know Ginnell?”</p>

<p>“Pat Ginnell?”</p>

<p>“That’s him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should think I did know the swab.
Why, he’s in with all the Greeks, and there’s
not a dog’s trick played in the bay he hasn’t
his thumb in. Him and his old shark boat.
Whatcher want me to do with him?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” replied Harman, “and maybe a lot.
I want you just to drop into the Fore and Aft and
sit and smoke your pipe at haff past three.
Then when I give you the wink you’ll pretend
to fall asleep. I just wants you as a witness.”</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” asked Captain Mike.</p>

<p>Harman told.</p>

<p>Had you been watching the two men from
a distance, you might have fancied that there
was a great joke between them from the laughter
of Captain Mike and the way in which
Harman was slapping his thigh. Then the
door closed, and Harman went off, steering
north through a maze of streets till he reached
his lodgings.</p>

<p>Here he packed a few things in a bundle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
had an interview with his landlady, a motherly
woman whose income was derived from a
washtub and two furnished bedrooms.</p>

<p>Among the other belongings which he took
with him was a box of quinine tabloids. These
he placed in the pocket of his coat, and, with
the bundle under his arm, departed.</p>

<p>It was five minutes past three when he entered
the dirty doggery misnamed the Fore
and Aft, and there before the bar behind
which Bone was serving drinks stood Ginnell.</p>

<p>Pat Ginnell, to give him his full name, was
an Irishman of the sure-fwhat type, who
might have been a bricklayer but for his decent
clothes and sea air and the big blue anchor
tattooed on the back of his left hand. There
was no one else in the bar.</p>

<p>“Here’s the gentleman,” said Bone, when
he sighted Harman. “Up to time and with
the goods to deliver, I dare say. Harman, this
is the Captain; where’s the hands?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harman, leaning his elbows on
the bar, “I believe I’ve got them. One of
them’s meself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“D’you mean to say you’re up to sign on
with me?” asked Ginnell.</p>

<p>“That’s my meanin’,” said Harman.</p>

<p>Ginnell looked at Bone. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“It won’t do,” said he. “I know you be
name, Mr. Harman; you’re in with Clancy
and that crowd, and my boat’s too rough for
the likes of you.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t fear about that,” said Harman.
“I’ve done with Clancy. What I’ve got
to do is get out of Frisco and get out quick.
The cops are after me; there you have it. I’ve
got to get out of here before night&mdash;do you
take me&mdash;and I’m so pressed to get out sudden
I’ll take your word for ten dollars a month
without any signin’.”</p>

<p>Ginnell’s brow cleared.</p>

<p>“What are you havin’?” said he.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a drink of whisky,” replied Harman.</p>

<p>The bargain was concluded.</p>

<p>“And how,” said Ginnell, “what about the
other chap?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Harman wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve made an arrangement with a chap to
meet me here,” said he. “He’ll be in in a minute.”</p>

<p>“What’s he like?” asked Ginnell.</p>

<p>“Like? Why, I’ll tell you what he’s like;
he wouldn’t sign on in your tub for a hundred
dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“Faith and you’re a nice sort of chap,” said
Ginnell. “Is it playin’ the fool with me you
are?”</p>

<p>By way of reply Harman took the box of
quinine tabloids from his pocket, opened it,
showed the contents, and winked.</p>

<p>Bone and Ginnell understood at once.</p>

<p>“One of those in his drink will lay him out
for an hour,” said Harman, “without hurtin’
him. Put one in your weskit pocket, Bone&mdash;and
how about your boat?”</p>

<p>“She’s down below at the stairs,” replied
the landlord, putting the tabloid in his waistcoat
pocket. “I’ll go and call Jim to get her
ready&mdash;a moment, gentlemen.” He vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
into a back room, and they heard him shouting
orders to Jim; then he returned, and as he
passed behind the bar who should enter but
Captain Mike!</p>

<p>The Captain walked to the bar, called for a
drink, and without as much as a glance at the
others took it to a seat in a far corner, where
he lit a pipe. Several wharf habitués loafed
in, and soon the place became hazy with tobacco
smoke and horrible with the smell of
rank cigars.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ginnell, “where’s your man?
I’m thinkin’ he’s given you the slip, and be
the powers, Mr. Harman, if he has, it’ll be the
worst for you.”</p>

<p>The brute in Ginnell spoke in his growl,
and Harman was turning over in his mind the
fate of any unfortunate who had Ginnell for
boss when the swing door opened and Blood
appeared.</p>

<p>“That’s him,” said Harman. “You leave
him to me.”</p>

<p>Blood was not the sort of man to frequent a
hole like the Fore and Aft, and he frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
spat when he came in. He was in a temper,
or rather the beginning of a temper, and Harman
seemed to have some difficulty in soothing
him. They had a confabulation together
near the corner where Captain Mike, his glass
and pipe on the table before him, was sitting,
evidently asleep, and then Blood, seeming to
agree with some matter under discussion, allowed
himself to be led to the bar.</p>

<p>“This is me friend, Captain Ginnell,” said
Harman. “Captain, this is me friend, Michael
Blood. Looking for a ship he is.”</p>

<p>“I can’t offer him a ship,” said Ginnell, “but
I can offer him a drink. What are you takin’,
sir?”</p>

<p>Blood called for a whisky.</p>

<p>The quinine tabloid popped into the bottom
of the glass by Bone dissolved almost immediately,
nor did Blood show that he detected
the presence in his drink. He loathed
quinine, and this forced dose added to the
flood of his steadily rising temper without,
however, interfering with his powers of self-control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a good actor, and the way he
clutched at the bar ledge shortly after he had
finished his drink left nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>“Let him lay down,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“I can’t leave the bar,” said Bone, “but if
the gentleman cares to lay down in my back
room he’s welcome.”</p>

<p>Blood, allowing himself to be conducted to
this resting place, Ginnell followed without
drawing the attention of the others in the bar.</p>

<p>Arrived in the back room, Blood collapsed
on an old couch by the window, and, lying
there with his eyes shut, he heard the rest.</p>

<p>He heard the whispered consultation between
Harman and the other, the trapdoor being
opened, Jim, the boatman, being called.
And then he felt a hand on his shoulder and
Ginnell’s voice adjuring him to rouse up a bit
and come along for a sail.</p>

<p>Helped on either side by the conspirators,
he allowed himself to be led to the trapdoor.</p>

<p>“We’ll never get him down them steps,” said
Harman, alluding to the stairs leading down
to where the boat was swaying on the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
water that was swishing and swashing against
the rotten piles of the wharf.</p>

<p>“This is the way it’s done,” said Ginnell,
and, twitching Blood’s feet from under him,
he sent him down the stairway like a bag of
meal to where Jim was waiting to receive him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At half past six o’clock that day the <em>Heart
of Ireland</em>&mdash;that was the name of Ginnell’s
boat&mdash;passed the tumble of the bar and took
the swell of the Pacific like a duck.</p>

<p>Ginnell, giving the wheel over to one of the
Chinese crew, glanced to windward, glanced
back at the coast, where Tamalpais stood
cloud-wrapped and gilded by the evening sun,
and then turned to the companionway leading
down to the hole of a cabin where they had deposited
their shanghaied man.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to rouse that swab up,” he said;
“he ought to be recovered by this.”</p>

<p>“Go easy with him,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“I’ll be as gentle with him as a mother,” replied
the skipper of the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>, with
a ferocious grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Harman watched the unfortunate man descending.
He had got shoulder deep down
the ladder when he suddenly vanished as if
snatched below, and his shout of astonishment
and the crash of his fall came up simultaneously
to the listener at the hatch.</p>

<p>Then came the sounds of the fight. Harman
had seen Blood fighting once, and he had no
fear at all for him. If he feared for any one,
it was Ginnell, who was crying now for mercy
and apparently receiving none. Then of a
sudden came silence, and Harman slipped
down the ladder.</p>

<p>Blood, during his incarceration, had ransacked
the cabin and secured the Captain’s revolver.
He was seated now, revolver in hand,
on Ginnell’s chest, and Ginnell was lying on
the cabin floor without a kick or an ounce of
fight in him.</p>

<p>“You haven’t killed him?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Blood. “Speak up,
you swab, and answer! Are you dead or not?”</p>

<p>“Faith, I don’t know,” groaned the unfortunate.
“I’m near done. What are you up to?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
What game is this you’re playin’ on me? Is
it murder or what?”</p>

<p>“Let me talk to him,” said Harman. “Pat
Ginnell, you’ve doped and shanghaied a man&mdash;meanin’
my friend, Captain Blood&mdash;and
I’ve got all the evidence and witnesses. Captain
Mike, of the Fish Patrol, is one; he came
to the Fore and Aft be request and saw the
whole game. That means the penitentiary for
you if we split. You’ll say I provided the
dope. Who’s to prove it? When I told you
the cops were after me I told a lie. Who’s to
prove it? I wanted you and your old tub, and
I’ve got ’em. Say a word against me and see
what Clancy will do to you. You shanghaied
me friend, and now you’re shanghaied yourself
in your own ship, and you’ll never dare to
have the law on us because, d’you see, we’ve
got the law on you. The Captain there has got
your revolver, the coolies on deck don’t care,
they never even turned a hair when they heard
you shoutin’. Now my question is, do you intend
to take it quiet, or would you sooner be
hove overboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Faith and there’s no use in kicking,” replied
the owner of the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>. “I
gives in.”</p>

<p>“Then up on your feet!” said Blood, rising
and putting the revolver in his pocket. “And
up on deck with you! You’re one of the hands
now, and if you ever want to see Frisco again,
you’ll take my orders and take them smart.
You’ll berth aft with us, but your rating is
cabin boy, and your pay. Up with you!”</p>

<p>Ginnell went up the ladder, and the others
followed.</p>

<p>Ginnell showed to the light of day two black
eyes and the marks on his chin of the frightful
uppercut that had closed the fight.</p>

<p>He looked like a beaten dog as Blood called
the crew, in order to pick watches with Harman.</p>

<p>“I take the chap that’s steering,” said Blood.</p>

<p>“And I takes Pat Ginnell,” said Harman.</p>

<p>They finished the business, and dismissed
the hands, who seemed to see nothing strange
in the recent occurrence among the whites,
and who were thronging now to the fo’c’s’le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for their supper, their faces all wearing the
same Chinese expression, the expression of
men who know everything, of men who know
nothing.</p>

<p>Then, having set a course for the San Lucas
Islands, and while Ginnell was washing himself
below, Blood, with his companion, leaned
on the rail and looked at the far-away coast
dying out in the dusk.</p>

<p>“Seems strange it was only this mornin’ I
projected gettin’ out like this,” said Harman,
“and here we are out, with twenty thousand
dollars ahead of us, if the <em>Yan-Shan</em> hasn’t
broke up, which she hasn’t. ’Pears to me it
was worth a dose of quinine to do the job so
neat with no bones broke and no fear of the
law at the end of it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said the Captain.</p>

<p>He whistled softly to the accompaniment of
the slashing of the bow wash, looking over toward
the almost vanished coast, above which,
in the pansy blue of the evening sky, stars were
now showing like points of silver.</p>

<h2>II<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE “YAN-SHAN”</span></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The <em>Heart of Ireland</em> was spreading her
wings to the northwest trades, making a good
seven knots with the coast of California a
vague line on the horizon to port and all the
blue Pacific before her.</p>

<p>Captain Blood was aft with his mate, leaning
on the rail and watching the foam boosting
away from the stern and flowing off in
Parian-Marbaline lines on the swirl of the
wake. Ginnell was forward on the lookout,
and one of the coolie crew was at the wheel.</p>

<p>“I’m not given to meeting trouble halfway,”
said Blood, shifting his position and leaning
with his left arm on the rail, “but it ’pears to
me Pat Ginnell is taking his set-down a mighty
sight too easy. He’s got something up his
sleeve.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“So’ve we,” replied Harman. “What can
he do? He laid out to shanghai you, and, by
gum, he did it. I don’t say I didn’t let him
down crool, playin’ into his hands and pretendin’
to help and gettin’ Captain Mike as a
witness, but the fac’ remains he got you aboard
this hooker by foul play, shanghaied you were,
and then you turns the tables on him, knocks
the stuffin’ out of him, and turns him into a
deck hand. How’s he to complain? I’d start
back to Frisco now and dare him to come
ashore with his complaints. We’ve got his
ship&mdash;well, that’s his fault. He’s no legs to
stand on, that’s truth.</p>

<p>“Leavin’ aside this little bisness, he’s known
as a crook from Benicia right to San José. The
bay reeks with him and his doin’s; settin’ Chinese
sturgeon lines, Captain Mike said he was,
and all but cocht, smugglin’ and playin’ up to
the Greeks, and worse. The bay side’s hungry
to catch him an’ stuff him in the penitentiary,
and he hasn’t no friends. I’m no saint, I
owns it, but I’m a plaster Madonna to Ginnell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and I’ve got friends, so have you. Well,
what are you bothering about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not bothering about the law,” said
Blood; “only about him. I’m going to keep
my eye open and not be put asleep by his quiet
ways&mdash;and I’d advise you to do the same.”</p>

<p>“Trust me,” said Harman, “and more especial
when we come to ’longsides with the
<em>Yan-Shan</em>.”</p>

<p>Now the <em>Yan-Shan</em> had started in life somewhere
early in the nineties as a twelve-hundred-ton
cargo boat in the Bullmer line; she had
been christened the <em>Robert Bullmer</em>, and her
first act when the dogshores had been knocked
away was a bull charge down the launching
slip, resulting in the bursting of a hawser, the
washing over of a boat, and the drowning of
two innocent spectators; her next was an attempt
to butt the Eddystone over in a fog, and,
being unbreakable, she might have succeeded
only that she was going dead slow. She drifted
out of the Bullmer line on the wash of a lawsuit
owing to the ramming by her of a Cape
boat in Las Palmas harbour; engaged herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in the fruit trade in the service of the Corona
Capuella Syndicate, and got on to the Swimmer
Rocks with a cargo of Jamaica oranges,
a broken screw shaft, and a blown-off cylinder
cover. The ruined cargo, salvage, and tow
ruined the syndicate, and the <em>Robert Bullmer</em>
found new occupations till the See-Yup-See
Company, of Canton, picked her up, and, rechristening,
used her for conveying coffins and
coolies to the American seaboard. They had
sent her to Valdivia on some business, and on
the return from the southern port to Frisco she
had, true to her instincts and helped by a gale,
run on San Juan, a scrap of an island north of
the Channel Islands off the California coast.
Every soul had been lost with the exception of
two Chinese coolies, who, drifting on a raft,
had been picked up and brought to San Francisco.</p>

<p>She had a general cargo and twenty thousand
dollars in gold coin on board, but the
coolies had declared her to be a total wreck;
said when they had last sighted her she was
going to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>That was the yarn Harman heard through
Clancy, with the intimation that the wreck was
not worth two dollars, let alone the expenses
of a salvage ship.</p>

<p>The story had eaten into Harman’s mind;
he knew San Juan better than any man in
Frisco, and he considered that a ship once
ashore there would stick; then Ginnell turned
up, and the luminous idea of inducing Ginnell
to shanghai Blood so that Blood might, with
his&mdash;Harman’s&mdash;assistance, shanghai Ginnell
and use the <em>Heart of Ireland</em> for the picking
of the <em>Yan-Shan’s</em> pocket entered his mind.</p>

<p>“It’s just when we come alongside the <em>Yan-Shan</em>
we may find our worse bother,” said
Blood.</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re pretty sure to send some sort
of a wrecking expedition to try and salve some
of the cargo, let alone those dollars.”</p>

<p>“See here,” said Harman, “I had the news
from Clancy that morning, and it had only
just come to Frisco; it wasn’t an hour old. We
put the cap on Ginnell, and were out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Golden Gate before sundown same day. A
wrecking ship would take all of two days to
get her legs under her, supposing any one
bought the wreck, so we have two days’ start.
We’ve been makin’ seven knots and maybe a
bit over; they won’t make more. So we have
two days to our good when we get there.”</p>

<p>“They may start a steamer out on the job,”
said Blood.</p>

<p>“Well, now, there’s where my knowledge
comes in,” said Harman. “There’s only two
salvage ships at present in Frisco, and rotten
tubs they are. One’s the <em>Maryland</em>. She’s
most a divin’ and dredgin’ ship; ain’t no good
for this sort of work; sea-bottom scrapin’ is
all she’s good for, and little she makes at it.
The other’s the <em>Port of Amsterdam</em>, owned by
Gunderman. She’s the ship they’d use. She’s
got steam winches and derricks ’nough to discharge
the Ark, and stowage room to hold the
cargo down to the last flea, <em>but</em> she’s no good
for more than eight knots; she steams like as
if she’s a drogue behind her, because why?
She’s got beam engines&mdash;she’s that old, she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
got beam engines in her. I’m not denyin’
there’s somethin’ to be said for them, but there
you are&mdash;there’s no speed in them.”</p>

<p>“Well, beam engines or no beam engines,
we’ll have a pretty rough time if she comes
down and catches us within a cable’s length of
the <em>Yan-Shan</em>,” said Blood. “However, there’s
no use in fetching trouble. Let’s go and have
a look at the lazaret; I want to see how we
stand for grub.”</p>

<p>Chopstick Charlie was the name Blood had
christened the coolie who acted as steward and
cabin hand. He called him now, and out of
the opium-tinctured gloom of the fo’c’s’le
Charlie appeared, received his orders, and led
them to the lazaret.</p>

<p>None of the crew had shown the slightest
emotion on seeing Blood take over command
of the schooner and Ginnell swabbing decks.
The fight that had made Blood master of the
<em>Heart of Ireland</em> and Ginnell’s revolver had
occurred in the cabin and out of sight of the
coolies, but even had it been conducted in full
view of them it is doubtful whether they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
have shown any feeling or lifted a hand in the
matter.</p>

<p>As long as their little privileges were regarded,
as long as opium bubbled in the evening
pipe, and pork, rice, and potatoes were
served out one white skipper was the same as
another to them.</p>

<p>The overhaul of the stores took half an hour,
and was fairly satisfactory. When they came
on deck, Blood, telling Charlie to take Ginnell’s
place as look-out, called the latter down
into the cabin.</p>

<p>“We want to have a word with you,” said
Blood, as Harman took his seat on a bunk edge
opposite him. “It’s time you knew our minds
and what we intend doing with the schooner
and yourself.”</p>

<p>“Faith,” said Ginnell, “I think it is.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you agree. Well, when you
shanghaied me on board this old shark boat
of yours, there’s little doubt as to what you intended
doing with <em>me</em>. Harman will tell you,
for we’ve talked on the matter.”</p>

<p>“He’d ’a’ worked you crool hard, fed you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
crool bad, and landed you, after a six months’
cruise, doped or drunk, with two cents in your
pocket and an affidavit up his sleeve that you’d
tried to fire his ship,” said Harman. “I know
the swab.”</p>

<p>Ginnell said nothing for a moment in answer
to this soft impeachment; he was cutting
himself a chew of tobacco. Then at last he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t want no certifikit of character from
either the pair of you,” said he. “You’ve boned
me ship, and you’ve blacked me eye, and
you’ve near stove me ribs in sittin’ on me chest
and wavin’ me revolver in me face. What I
wants to know is your game. Where’s your
profits to come from on this job?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” replied Blood. “There’s a
hooker called the <em>Yan-Shan</em> piled on the rocks
down the coast, and we’re going to leave our
cards on her&mdash;savvy?”</p>

<p>“O Lord!” said Ginnell.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, d’you say?” cried Ginnell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
“Why, it’s the <em>Yan-Shan</em> I was after meself.”</p>

<p>Blood stared at the owner of the <em>Heart of
Ireland</em> for a moment, then he broke into a
roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you bought the
wreck?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not me,” replied Ginnell. “Sure, where
d’you think I’d be findin’ the money to buy
wrecks with? I had news that mornin’ she
was lyin’ there derelick, and I was just slippin’
down the coast to have a look at her when you
two spoiled me lay by takin’ me ship.”</p>

<p>It was now that Harman began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, if that don’t beat all!” said he. “And
maybe, since you were so keen on havin’ a look
at her, you’ve brought wreckin’ tools with you
in case they might come in handy?”</p>

<p>“That’s as may be,” replied Ginnell. “What
you have got to worry about isn’t wreckin’
tools, but how to get rid of the boodle if it’s
there. Twenty thousand dollars, that’s the figure.”</p>

<p>“So you know of the dollars,” said Blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, what do you take me for?” asked Ginnell.
“D’you think I’d have bothered about
the job only for the dollars? What’s the use
of general cargo to the like of me? Now what
I’m thinkin’ is this, you want a fence to help
you to get rid of the stuff. Supposin’ you find
it, how are you to cart this stuff ashore and
bank it? You’ll be had, sure, but not if I’m
at your back. Now, gents, I’m willin’ to wipe
out all differences and help in the salvin’ on
shares, and I’ll make it easy for you. You’ll
each take seven thousand, and I’ll take the balance,
and I won’t charge nuthin’ for the loan
you’ve took of the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>. It’s a
losin’ game for me, but it’s better than bein’
done out entirely.”</p>

<p>Blood looked at Harman, and Harman
looked at Blood. Then telling Ginnell that
they would consider the matter, they went on
deck to talk it over.</p>

<p>There was truth in what Ginnell said. They
would want help in getting the coin ashore in
safety, and, unless they marooned or murdered
Ginnell, he, if left out, would always be a witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to make trouble. Besides, though engaged
on a somewhat shady business, neither Blood
nor Harman was a scoundrel. Ginnell up to
this had been paid out in his own coin, the slate
was clean, and it pleased neither of them to
take profit from this blackguard beyond what
they considered their due.</p>

<p>It was just this touch of finer feeling that
excluded them from the category of rogues
and made their persons worth considering and
their doings worth recounting.</p>

<p>“We’ll give him what he asks,” said Blood,
when the consultation was over, “and, mind
you, I don’t like giving it him one little bit,
not on account of the money, but because it
seems to make us partners with that swab. I
tell you this, Billy Harman, I’d give half as
much again if an honest man was dealing with
us in this matter instead of Pat Ginnell.”</p>

<p>“And what honest man would deal with
us?” asked the ingenuous Harman. “Lord!
One might think the job we was on was tryin’
to sell a laundry. It’s <em>safe</em> enough, for who
can say we didn’t hit the wreck cruisin’ round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
promiscuous, but it won’t hold no frills in the
way of honesty and such. Down with you,
and close the bargain with that chap and tip
him the wink that, though we’re mugs enough
to give him six thousand dollars for the loan
of his old shark boat, we’re men enough to put
a pistol bullet in his gizzard if he tries any
games with us. Down you go.”</p>

<p>Blood went.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Next morning, an hour after sunrise,
through the blaze of light striking the Pacific
across the far-off Californian coast, San Juan
showed like a flake of spar on the horizon to
southward.</p>

<p>The sea there was all of an impossible blueness,
the Pacific blue deepened by the Kuro
Shiwo current, that mysterious river of the sea
which floods up the coast of Japan, crosses the
Pacific toward Alaska, and sweeps down the
West American seaboard to fan out and lose
itself away down somewhere off Chile.</p>

<p>Harman judged the island to be twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
miles away, and as they were making six and
a half knots, he reckoned to hit it in three
hours if the wind held.</p>

<p>They went down and had breakfast, and
after the meal Ginnell, going to the locker
where he had stowed the wrecking tools,
fetched them out and laid them on deck.
There were two crowbars and a jimmy, not to
mention a flogging hammer, a rip saw, some
monstrous big chisels, and a shipwright’s mallet.
They looked like a collection of burglar’s
implements from the land of Brobdignag.</p>

<p>“There you are,” said Ginnell. “You never
know what you may want on a job like this,
with bulkheads maybe to be cut through and
chests broke open. Get a spare sail, Misther
Harman, and rowl the lot up in it so’s they’ll
be aisier for thransport.”</p>

<p>He was excited, and the Irish in him came
out when he was like that; also, as the most
knowledgable man in the business, he was taking
the lead. You never could have fancied,
from his cheerful manner and his appearance
of boss, that Blood was the real master of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
situation, or that Blood, only a few days ago,
had nearly pounded the life out of him, captured
his revolver, and taken possession of the
<em>Heart of Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>The schooner carried a whaleboat, and this
was now got in readiness for lowering, with
provisions and water for the landing party,
and, when that was done, the island, now only
four miles distant, showed up fine, a sheer
splinter of volcanic rock standing up from the
sea and creamed about with foam.</p>

<p>Not a sign of a wreck was to be seen, though
Ginnell’s glasses were powerful enough to
show up every detail from the rock fissures to
the roosting gulls.</p>

<p>Gloom fell upon the party, with the exception
of Harman.</p>

<p>“It’ll be on the other side if it’s there at all,”
said he. “She’d have been coming up from
the s’uth’ard, and if the gale was behind her,
it would have taken her right on to the rocks;
she couldn’t be on this side, anyhow, because
why? There’s nuthin’ to hold her. It’s a mile-deep
water off them cliffs, but on the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
it shoals gradual from tide marks to ten-fathom
water, which holds for a quarter of a
mile. Keep her as she is; you could scrape
them cliffs with a battleship without danger
of groundin’.”</p>

<p>After a minute or two, he took the wheel
himself, and steered her, while the fellows
stood by the halyards, ready to let go at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>It was an impressive place, this north side
of the island of San Juan. The heavy swell
came up, smacking right on to the sheer cliff
wall, jetting green water and foam yards high
to the snore and boom of caves and cut-outs in
the rock. Gulls haunted the place. The black
petrel, the Western gull, and the black-footed
albatross all were to be found here. Long lines
of white gulls marked the cliff edges, and, far
above, in the dazzling azure of the sky, a
Farallon cormorant circled like the spirit of
the place, challenging the newcomers with its
cry.</p>

<p>Harman shifted his helm, and the <em>Heart of
Ireland</em>, with main boom swinging to port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
came gliding past the western rocks and opening
the sea to southward, where, far on the
horizon, lovely in the morning light like vast
ships under press of sail, the San Lucas Islands
lay remote in the morning splendour.</p>

<p>Away to port the line of the Californian
coast showed beyond the heave of the sea from
Point Arguello to Point Concepcion, and to
starboard and west of the San Lucas a dot in
the sun dazzle marked the peaks of the island
of San Nicolas.</p>

<p>Then, as the <em>Heart of Ireland</em> came round
and the full view of the south of San Juan
burst upon them, the wreck piled on the rocks
came in sight, and anchored quarter of a mile
off the shore&mdash;a Chinese junk!</p>

<p>Harman swore.</p>

<p>Ginnell, seizing his glasses, rushed forward
and looked through them at the wreck.</p>

<p>“It’s swarmin’ with chows,” cried he, coming
aft “They seem to have only just landed
be the look of them. Keep her as she goes, and
be ready with the anchor there forrard; we’ll
scupper them yet. Mr. Harman, be plazed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
fetch up that lin’th of lead pipe you’ll find on
the cabin flure be the door. Capt’in, will you
see with Charlie here to the boat while I get
the anchor ready for droppin’? Them coolies
is all thumbs.”</p>

<p>He went forward, and the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>,
with the wind spilling out of her mainsail,
came along over the heaving blue swell, satin-smooth
here in the shelter of the island.</p>

<p>Truly the <em>Yun-Shan</em>, late <em>Robert Bullmer</em>,
had made a masterpiece of her last business.
She had come stem on, lifted by the piling sea,
and had hit the rocks, smashing every bow
plate from the keel to within a yard or two of
the gunwale, then a wave had taken her under
the stern and lifted her and flung her broadside
on, just as she now lay, pinned to her position
by the rock horns that had gored her side, and
showing a space of her rust-red bottom to the
sun.</p>

<p>The water was squattering among the rocks
right up to her, the phosphor-bronze propeller
showed a single blade cocked crookedly at the
end of the broken screw shaft; rudder there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was none, the funnel was gone, spar deck and
bridge were in wreck and ruin, while the cowl
of a bent ventilator turned seaward seemed
contemplating with a languid air the beauty of
the morning and the view of the far-distant
San Lucas Islands.</p>

<p>The <em>Heart of Ireland</em> picked up a berth inside
the junk, and as the rasp and rattle of the
anchor chain came back in faint echoes from
the cliff, a gong on the junk woke to life and
began to snarl and roar its warning to the fellows
on the wreck.</p>

<p>“Down with the boat!” cried Ginnell.
With the “lin’th of lead pipe,” a most formidable
weapon, sticking from his pocket, he
ran to help with the falls. The whaleboat
smacked the water, the crew tumbled in, and
with Ginnell in the bow, it started for the
shore.</p>

<p>The gong had done its work. The fellows
who had been crawling like ants over the dead
body of the <em>Yan-Shan</em> came slithering down
on ropes, appeared running and stumbling
over the rocks abaft the stern, some hauling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
along sacks of loot, others brandishing sticks
or bits of timber, and all shouting and clamouring
with a noise like gulls whose nests are
being raided.</p>

<p>There was a small scrap of shingly beach
off which the Chinamen’s scow was lying anchored
with a stone and with a China boy
for anchor watch. The whaleboat passed the
scow, dashed nose end up the shelving beach,
and the next moment Ginnell and his lin’th of
lead pipe was among the Chinamen, while
Blood, following him, was firing his revolver
over their heads. Harman, with a crowbar
carried at the level, was aiming straight at
the belly of the biggest of the foe when they
parted right and left, dropping everything,
beaten before they were touched, and making
for the water over the rocks.</p>

<p>Swimming like rats, they made for the
scow, scrambled on board her, howked up the
anchor stone, and shot out the oars.</p>

<p>“They’re off for the junk,” cried Ginnell.
“Faith, that was a clane bit of work! Look
at thim rowin’ as if the divil was after thim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>They were literally, and now on board the
junk they were hauling the boat in, shaking
out the lateen sail, and dragging up the anchor
as though a hundred pair of hands were at
work instead of twenty.</p>

<p>Then as the huge sail bellied gently to the
wind, and the junk broke the violet breeze
shadow beyond the calm of the sheltered
water, a voice came over the sea, a voice like
the clamour of a hundred gulls, thin, rending,
fierce as the sound of tearing calico.</p>

<p>“Shout away, me boys!” said Ginnell.
“You’ve got the shout and we’ve got the
boodle, and good day to ye!”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>He turned with the others to examine the
contents of the sacks dropped by the vanquished
ones and lying among the rocks.
They were old gunny bags, and they were
stuffed with all sorts of rubbish and valuables&mdash;musical
instruments, bits of old metal, cabin
curtains, and even cans of bully beef; there
was no sign of dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fools were so busy picking up everything
they could find lying about they hadn’t
time to search for the real stuff,” said Blood.
“Didn’t know of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ginnell, “stick the ould truck
back in the bags with the insthruments; we’ll
sort it out when we get aboard, and fling the
rubbish over and keep what’s worth keepin’.”</p>

<p>Helped by the coolies, they refilled the bags,
and left them in position for carrying off, and
then, led by Ginnell, they made round the
stern of the wreck to the port side.</p>

<p>Now on the sea side the <em>Yan-Shan</em> presented
a bad enough picture of desolation and destruction,
but here on the land side the sight
was terrific.</p>

<p>The great yellow funnel had crashed over
onto the rocks, and lay with lengths of the
guys still adhering to it; a quarter boat, with
bottom half out, had gone the way of the funnel;
crabs were crawling over all sorts of raffle&mdash;broken
spars, canvas from the bridge
screen, and woodwork of the chart house,
while all forward of amidships, the plates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
beaten and twisted and ripped apart, showed
cargo, held, or in the act of escaping. One
big packing case, free of the ship, had resolved
itself into staves round its once contents,
a piano that appeared perfectly uninjured.</p>

<p>A rope ladder hung from the bulwarks
amidships, and up it Ginnell went followed
by the others, reaching a roofless passage that
had once been the port alleyway.</p>

<p>Here on the slanting deck one got a full picture
of the ruin that had come on the ship.
The masts were gone as well as the funnel,
boats, ventilators&mdash;with the exception of the
twisted cowl looking seaward&mdash;bridge, chart
house, all had vanished wholly or in part, a
picture made more impressive by the calm
blue sky overhead and the brilliancy of the
sunlight.</p>

<p>The locking bars had been removed from
the cover of the fore hatch, and the hatch
opened evidently by the Chinese in search of
plunder. Ginnell scarcely turned an eye on it
before he made aft, followed by the others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
reached the saloon companionway, and dived
down it.</p>

<p>If the confusion on deck was bad, it was
worse below. The cabin doors on either side
were either open or off their hinges, bunk
bedding, mattresses, an open and rifled valise,
some women’s clothes, an empty cigar box, and
a cage with a dead canary in it lay on the
floor.</p>

<p>The place looked as if an army of pillagers
had been at work for days, and the sight struck
a chill to the hearts of the beholders.</p>

<p>“We’re dished,” said Ginnell. “Quick,
boys, if the stuffs anywhere, it’ll be in the old
man’s cabin; there’s no mail room in a packet
like this. If it’s not there, we’re done.”</p>

<p>They found the Captain’s cabin; they found
his papers tossed about, his cash box open and
empty, and a strong box clamped to the deck
by the bunk in the same condition. They
found, to complete the business, an English
sovereign on the floor in a corner.</p>

<p>Ginnell sat down on the edge of the bunk.</p>

<p>“They’ve got the dollars,” said he. “That’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
why they legged it so quick, and&mdash;we let them
go. Twenty thousand dollars in gold coin,
and we let them go. Tear an ages! Afther
them!” He sprang from the bunk, and dashed
through the saloon, followed by the others.
On deck, they strained their eyes seaward,
toward a brown spot on the blue far, far away
to the sou’west. It was the junk making a
soldier’s wind of it, every inch of sail spread.
Judging by the distance she had covered, she
must have been making at least eight knots,
and the <em>Heart of Ireland</em> under similar wind
conditions was incapable of more than seven.</p>

<p>“No good chasing her,” said Blood.</p>

<p>“Not a happorth,” replied Ginnell. Then
the quarrel began.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t held us pokin’ over them old
sacks on the rocks there, we’d maybe have had
a chance of overhaulin’ her,” said Ginnell.</p>

<p>“Sacks!” cried Blood. “What are you talking
about? It was you who let them go, shouting
good day to them and telling them we’d
got the boodle!”</p>

<p>“Boodle!” cried Ginnell. “You’re a nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
chap to talk about boodle. You did me up an’
collared me boat, and now you’re let down
proper, and serve you right.”</p>

<p>Blood was about to reply in kind, when the
dispute was cut short by a loud yell from the
engine-room hatch.</p>

<p>Harman, having satisfied himself with a
glance that all was up with the junk, had gone
poking about, and entered the engine-room
hatchway. He now appeared, shouting like a
maniac.</p>

<p>“The dollars!” he cried. “Two dead
chinkies an’ the dollars!”</p>

<p>He vanished again with a shout. They
rushed to the hatch, and there, on the steel
grating leading to the ladder, curled together
like two cats that had died in battle, lay the
Chinamen. Harman, kneeling beside them,
his hands at work on the neck of a tied sack
that clinked as he shook it with the glorious,
rich, mellow sound that gold in bulk and gold
in specie alone can give.</p>

<p>The lanyard came away, and Harman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
plunging his big hand in, produced it filled
with British sovereigns.</p>

<p>Not one of them moved or said a word for a
moment; then Ginnell suddenly squatted
down on the grating beside Harman, and, taking
a sovereign between finger and thumb
gingerly, as though he feared it might burn
him, examined it with a laugh. Then he bit
it, spun it in the air, caught it in his left hand,
and brought his great right palm down on it
with a bang.</p>

<p>“Hids or tails!” cried Ginnell. “Hids I
win, tails you lose!” He gave a coarse laugh
as he opened his palm where the coin lay
tail up.</p>

<p>“Hids it is,” he cried; then he tossed it back
into the bag and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” said he, “let’s bring the
stuff down to the saloon and count it.”</p>

<p>“Better get it aboard,” said Blood.</p>

<p>Harman looked up. The grin on his face
stamped by the finding of the gold was still
there, and in the light coming through the
hatch his forehead showed, beaded with sweat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m with Ginnell,” said he. “Let’s get
down to the saloon for an overhaul. I can’t
wait whiles we row off to the schooner. I
wants to feel the stuff, and I wants to divide it
right off and now. Boys, we’re rich; we sure
are. It’s the stroke of my life, and I can’t
wait for no rowin’ on board no schooners before
we divide up.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” said Blood.</p>

<p>The sack was much bigger than its contents,
so there was plenty of grip for him as he seized
one corner. Then, Harman grasping it by the
neck, they lugged it out and along the deck
and down the saloon companionway, Ginnell
following.</p>

<p>The Chinese had opened nearly all the
cabin portholes for the sake of light to assist
them in their plundering, and now, as Blood
and Harman placed the sack on the slanting
saloon table, the crying of gulls came clearly
and derisively from the cliffs outside, mixed
with the hush of the sea and the boost of the
swell as it broke, creaming and squattering
amid the rocks. The lackadaisical ventilator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
cowl, which took an occasional movement
from stray puffs of air, added its voice now
and then, whining and complaining like some
lost yet inconsiderable soul.</p>

<p>No other sound could be heard as the three
men ranged themselves, Ginnell on the starboard,
and Blood and Harman on the port
side of the table.</p>

<p>The swivel seats, though all aslant, were
practicable, and Harman was in the act of
taking his place in the seat he had chosen
when Ginnell interposed.</p>

<p>“One moment, Mr. Harman,” said the
owner of the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>, “I’ve a word to
say to you and Mr. Blood&mdash;sure, I beg your
pardon&mdash;I mane Capt’in Blood.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Blood, grasping a chair back,
“what have you to say?”</p>

<p>“Only this,” replied Ginnell, with a grin.
“I’ve got back me revolver.”</p>

<p>Blood clapped his hand to his pocket. It
was empty.</p>

<p>“I picked your pocket of it,” said Ginnell,
producing the weapon, “two minits back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
You fired three shots over the heads of them
chows, and there’s three ca’tridges left in her.
I can hit a dollar at twinty long paces. Move
an inch, either the one or other of you, and
I’ll lay your brains on the table forenint you.”</p>

<p>They did not move, for they knew that he
was in earnest. They knew that if they moved
he would begin to shoot, and if he began to
shoot, he would finish the job, leave their
corpses on the floor, and sail off with the dollars
and his Chinese crew in perfect safety.
There were no witnesses.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ginnell, “what the pair of you
has to do is this: Misther Harman, you’ll go
into that cabin behind you, climb on the upper
bunk, stick your head through the porthole,
and shout to the coolies down below there with
the boat to come up. It’ll take two men to get
them dollars on deck and down to the wather
side. When you’ve done that, the pair of you
will walk into the ould man’s cabin an’ say
your prayers, thanking the saints you’ve got
off so easy, whiles I puts the bolt on you till
the dollars are away. And remimber this, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
word or kick from you and I shoot; the Chinamen
will never tell.”</p>

<p>“See here!” said Harman.</p>

<p>“One word!” shouted Ginnell, suddenly
dropping the mask of urbanity and leveling
the pistol.</p>

<p>It was as though the tiger cat in his grimy
soul had suddenly burst bonds and mastered
him. His finger pressed on the trigger, and
the next moment Harman’s brains, or what he
had of them, might have been literally “forenint”
him on the table, when suddenly, tremendous
as the last trumpet, paralyzing as the
inrush of a body of armed men, booing and
bellowing back from the cliffs in a hundred
echoes came a voice&mdash;the blast of a ship’s
siren:</p>

<p>“Huroop! Hirrip! Hurop! Haar&mdash;haar&mdash;haar!”</p>

<p>Ginnell’s arm fell. Harman, forgetting
everything, turned, dashed into the cabin behind
him, climbed on the upper bunk, and
stuck his head through the porthole.</p>

<p>Then he dashed back into the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the <em>Port of Amsterdam</em>,” cried Harman.
“It’s the salvage ship; she’s there droppin’
her anchor. We’re done, we’re dished&mdash;and
we foolin’ like this and they crawlin’ up
on us.”</p>

<p>“And you said she’d only do eight knots!”
cried Blood.</p>

<p>Ginnell flung the revolver on the floor.
Every trace of the recent occurrence had vanished,
and the three men thought no more of
one another than a man thinks of petty matters
in the face of dissolution. Gunderman
was outside; that was enough for them.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Ginnell, “ain’t there no way
out with them dollars? S’pose we howk them
ashore?”</p>

<p>“Cliffs two hundred foot high!” said Harman.
“Not a chanst. We’re dished.”</p>

<p>Said Blood: “There’s only one thing left.
We’ll walk the dollars down to the boat and
row off with them. Of course we’ll be
stopped, still there’s the chance that Gunderman
may be drunk or something. It’s one
chance in a hundred billion; it’s the only one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>But Gunderman was not drunk, nor were
his boat party, and the court-martial he held
on the beach in broken English and with the
sack of coin beside him as chief witness would
form a bright page of literature had one time
to record it.</p>

<p>Ginnell, as owner of the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>,
received the whole brunt of the storm&mdash;there
was no hearing for him when, true to himself,
he tried to cast the onus of the business on
Blood and Harman. He was told to get out
and be thankful he was not brought back to
Frisco in irons, and he obeyed instructions,
rowing off to the schooner, he and Harman
and Blood, a melancholy party with the exception
of Blood, who was talking to Harman
with extreme animation on the subject of beam
engines.</p>

<p>On deck, it was Blood who gave orders for
hauling up the anchor and setting sail. He
had recaptured the revolver.</p>

<h2>III<br />
<span class="titlefont">A CARGO OF CHAMPAGNE</span></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Billy Meersam, an old sailor friend in
Frisco, told me this story as I was sitting one
day on Rafferty’s wharf, contemplating the
green water, and smoking. Billy chewed and
spat between paragraphs. We were discussing
Captain Pat Ginnell and his ways; and
Billy, who had served his time on hard ships,
and, as a young man, on the <em>Three Brothers</em>,
that tragedy of the sea which now lies a coal
hulk in Gibraltar harbour, had quite a lot to
say on hazing captains in general and Captain
Pat Ginnell in particular.</p>

<p>“I had one trip with him,” said Billy, “shark
catchin’ down the coast in that old dough dish
of his, the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>. Treated me crool
bad, he did; crool bad he treated me from first
to last; his beef was as hard as his fist, and bud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
barley he served out for coffee. He was known
all along the shore side, but he got his gruel
at last, and got it good. Now, by any chance
did you ever hear of a Captain Mike Blood
and his mate, Billy Harman? Knew the parties,
did you? Well, now, I’ll tell you. Blood
it were put the hood on Ginnell. Ginnell laid
out to get the better of Blood, and Blood,
he got the better of Ginnell. He and Harman
signed on for a cruise in the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>;
then they rose on Ginnell, and took the
ship and made him deck hand. They did that.
They made a line for a wreck they knew of on
a rock be name of San Juan, off the San Lucas
Islands, and the three of them were peeling
that wreck, and they were just gettin’ twenty
thousand dollars in gold coin off her, when the
party who’d bought the wreck, and his name
was Gunderman, lit down on them and collared
the boodle and kicked them back into
their schooner, givin’ them the choice of makin’
an offing or takin’ a free voyage back to
Frisco, with a front seat in the penitentiary
thrown in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was a crool setback for them, the dollars
hot in their hands one minit and took away
the next, you may say, but they didn’t quarrel
over it; they set out on a new lay, and this is
what happened with Cap’ Ginnell.”</p>

<p>But, with Mr. Meersam’s leave, I will take
the story from his mouth and tell it in my own
way, with additions gathered from the chief
protagonists and from other sources.</p>

<p>When the three adventurers, dismissed with
a caution by Gunderman, got sail on the <em>Heart
of Ireland</em>, they steered a sou’westerly course,
till San Juan was a speck to northward and
the San Lucas Islands were riding high on the
sea on the port quarter.</p>

<p>Then Blood hove the schooner to for a council
of war, and Ginnell, though reduced again
to deck hand, was called into it.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Blood, “that’s over and done
with, and there’s no use calling names. Question
is what we’re to do now. We’ve missed
twenty thousand dollars through fooling and
delaying, and we’ve got to make good somehow,
even on something small. If I had ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
cents in my pocket, Pat Ginnell, I’d leave you
and your old shark boat for the nearest point
of land and hoof it back to Frisco; but I
haven’t&mdash;worse luck.”</p>

<p>“There’s no use in carryin’ on like that,”
said Harman. “Frisco’s no use to you or me,
and your boots would be pretty well wore out
before you got there. What I say is this:
We’ve got a schooner that’s rigged out for
shark fishin’. Well, let’s go on that lay; we’ll
give Ginnell a third share, and he’ll share with
us in payin’ the coolies. Shark oil’s fetchin’
big prices now in Frisco. It’s not twenty thousand
dollars, but it’s somethin’.”</p>

<p>Ginnell, leaning against the after rail and
cutting himself a fill of tobacco, laughed in a
mirthless way. Then he spoke: “Shark fishin’,
begob; well, there’s a word to be said be
me on that. You two thought yourselves
mighty clever, collarin’ me boat and makin’
yourselves masthers of it. I don’t say you
didn’t thrump me ace, I don’t say you didn’t
work it so that I can’t have the law on you,
but I’ll say this, Misther Harman, if you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to go shark fishin’, you can work the business
yourself, and a nice hand you’ll make of it.
Why, you don’t know the grounds, let alone
the work. A third share, and me the rightful
owner of this tub! I’ll see you ham-strung
before I put a hand to it.”</p>

<p>“Then get forrard,” said Harman. “Don’t
know the grounds? Maybe I don’t know the
grounds you used to work farther north, but
I know every foot of the grounds here-a-way,
right from the big kelp beds to the coast.
Why, I been on the fish-commission ship and
worked with ’em all through this part, takin’
soundin’s and specimens&mdash;rock, weed, an’ fish.
Know the bottom here as well as I know the
pa’m of me hand.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you know it so well, you’ve no need
of me. Lay her on the grounds yourself,” said
Ginnell.</p>

<p>He went forward.</p>

<p>“Black sullen,” said Harman, looking after
him. “He ain’t no use to lead or drive. Well,
let’s get her before the wind an’ crowd down
closer to Santa Catalina. I’m not sayin’ this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
is a good shark ground, the sea’s too much of
a blame’ fish circus just here&mdash;but it’s better
than nothin’.”</p>

<p>They got the <em>Heart</em> before the wind, which
had died down to a three-knot breeze, Blood
steering and Harman forward, on the lookout.</p>

<p>Harman was right, the sea round these
coasts is a fish circus, to give it no better name.</p>

<p>The San Lucas Islands and Santa Catalina
seem the rendezvous of most of the big fish
inhabiting the Pacific. Beginning with San
Miguel, the islands run almost parallel to the
California coast in a sou’westerly direction,
and, seen now from the schooner’s deck, they
might have been likened to vast ships under
press of sail, so tall were they above the sea
shimmer and so white in the sunshine their
fog-filled cañons.</p>

<p>Away south, miles and miles away across
the blue water, the peaks of Santa Catalina
Island showed a dream of vague rose and gold.</p>

<p>It was for Santa Catalina that Harman was
making now.</p>

<p>To tell the whole truth, bravely as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
talked of his knowledge of these waters, he
was not at all sure in his mind as to their
shark-bearing capacity. He did not know that
for a boat whose business was shark-liver oil,
this bit of sea was not the happiest hunting
ground.</p>

<p>Nothing is more mysterious than the way
fish make streets in the sea and keep to them;
make cities, so to say, and inhabit them at certain
seasons; make playgrounds, and play in
them.</p>

<p>Off the north of Santa Catalina Island you
will find Yellow Fin. Cruise down on the
seaward side and you will find a spot where
the Yellow Fin vanish and the Yellow Tail
take their place; farther south you strike the
street of the White Sea Bass, which opens on
to Halibut Square, which, in turn, gives upon
a vast area, where the Black Sea Bass, the
Swordfish, the Albacore, and the Whitefish
are at home.</p>

<p>Steer round the south of the island and you
hit the suburbs of the great fish city of the
Santa Catalina Channel. The Grouper Banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
are its purlieus, and the Sunfish keeps guard
of its southern gate. You pass Barracuda
Street and Bonito Street, till the roar of the
Sea Lions from their rocks tells you that you
are approaching the Washington Square of
undersea things&mdash;the great Tuna grounds.</p>

<p>Skirting the Tuna grounds, and right down
the Santa Catalina Channel, runs a Broadway
which is also a Wall Street, where much business
is done in the way of locomotion and destruction.
Here are the Killer Whales and
the Sulphur-bottom Whales and the Grey
Whales, and the Porpoises, Dolphins, Skipjacks,
and Sand Dabs.</p>

<p>Sharks you will find nearly everywhere, <em>but</em>,
and this was a fact unknown to Harman, the
sharks, as compared to the other big fish, are
few and far between.</p>

<p>It was getting toward sundown, when the
schooner, under a freshening wind, came along
the seaward side of Santa Catalina Island.
The island on this side shows two large bays,
separated by a rounded promontory. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
northernmost of these bays they dropped anchor
close in shore, in fifteen-fathom water.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>At dawn next morning they got the gear
ready. The Chinese crew, during the night,
had caught a plentiful supply of fish for bait,
and, as the sun was looking over the coast
hills, they hauled up the anchor and put out
for the kelp beds.</p>

<p>There are two great kelp beds off the seaward
coast of Santa Catalina, an inner and an
outer. Two great submarine forests more
thickly populated than any forest on land.
This is the haunt of the Black Sea Bass that
run in weight up to four hundred pounds, the
Ribbon Fish, the Frogfish, and the Kelpfish,
that builds its nest just as a bird builds, crabs
innumerable, and sea creatures that have never
yet been classified or counted.</p>

<p>They tied up to the kelp, and the fishing began,
while the sun blazed stronger upon the
water and the morning mists died out of the
cañons of the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The shark hooks baited and lowered were
relieved of their bait, but not by sharks; all
sorts of bait snatchers inhabit these waters,
and they were now simply chewing the fish off
the big shark hooks.</p>

<p>Getting on for eleven o’clock, Blood, who
had been keeping a restless eye seaward, left
his line and went forward with Ginnell’s glass,
which he levelled at the horizon.</p>

<p>A sail on the sea line to the northwest had
attracted his attention an hour ago, and the
fact that it had scarcely altered its position,
although there was a six-knot breeze blowing,
had roused his curiosity.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Harman.</p>

<p>“Schooner hove to,” said Blood. “No,
b’gosh, she’s not; she’s abandoned.”</p>

<p>At the word “abandoned,” Ginnell, who had
been fishing for want of something better to
do, raised his head like a bird of prey.</p>

<p>He also left his line, and came forward.
Blood handed him the glass.</p>

<p>“Faith, you’re right,” said Ginnell; “she’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
derelick. Boys, up with them tomfool shark
lines; here’s a chanst of somethin’ decent.”</p>

<p>For once Blood and Harman were completely
with him; the lines were hauled in, the
kelp connections broken, mainsail and jib set,
and in a moment, as it were, the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>
was bounding on the swell, topsail and
foresail shaking out now and bellying against
the blue till she heeled almost gunwale under
to the merry wind, boosting the green water
from her bow, and sending the foam flooding
in sheets to starboard.</p>

<p>It was as though the thought of plunder had
put new heart and life into her, as it certainly
had into her owner, Pat Ginnell.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer, they saw the condition
of the schooner more clearly. Derelict and
deserted, yet with mainsail set, she hung there,
clawing at the wind and thrashing about in the
mad manner of a vessel commanded only by
her tiller.</p>

<p>Now the mainsail would fill and burst out,
the boom swaying over to the rattle of block
and cordage. For a moment she would give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
an exhibition of just how a ship ought to sail
herself, and then, with a shudder, the air
would spill from the sail, and, like a daft
woman in a blowing wind, she would reel
about with swinging gaff and boom to the
tune of the straining rigging, the pitter-patter
of the reef points, and the whine of the rudder
nearly torn from its pintles.</p>

<p>A couple of cable lengths away the <em>Heart of
Ireland</em> hove to, the whaleboat was lowered,
and Blood, Ginnell, and Harman, leaving
Chopstick Charlie in charge of the <em>Heart</em>,
started for the derelict. They came round the
stern of the stranger, and read her name, <em>Tamalpais</em>,
done in letters that had been white,
but were now a dingy yellow.</p>

<p>Then they came along the port side and
hooked on to the fore channels, while Blood
and the others scrambled on deck.</p>

<p>The deck was clean as a ballroom floor and
sparkling with salt from the dried spray;
there was no raffle or disorder of any sort.
Every boat was gone, and the falls, swinging at
full length from the davits, proclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
fact that the crew had left the vessel in an orderly
manner, though hurriedly enough, no
doubt; had abandoned her, leaving the falls
swinging and the rudder playing loose and the
winds to do what they willed with her.</p>

<p>There was no sign of fire, no disorder that
spoke of mutiny, though in cargo and with a
low freeboard, she rode free of water, one
could tell that by the movement of her underfoot.
Fire, leak, mutiny, those are the three
reasons for the abandonment of a ship at sea,
and there was no sign of any one of them.</p>

<p>Blood led the way aft, the saloon hatch was
open, and they came down into the tiny saloon.
The sunlight through the starboard portholes
was spilling about in water shimmers on the
pitch-pine panelling; everything was in order,
and a meal was set out on the table, which
showed a Maconochie jam tin, some boiled
pork, and a basket of bread; plates were laid
for two, and the plates had been used.</p>

<p>“Beats all,” said Harman, looking round.
“Boys, this is a find as good as the dollars.
Derelict and not a cat on board, and she’s all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of ninety tons. Then there’s the cargo. B’ Jiminy,
but we’re in luck!”</p>

<p>“Let’s roust out the cabins,” said Ginnell.</p>

<p>They found the Captain’s cabin, easily
marked by its size and its furniture.</p>

<p>Some oilskins and old clothes were hanging
up by the bunk, a sea chest stood open. It had
evidently been rifled of its most precious contents;
there was nothing much left in it but
some clothes, a pair of sea boots, and some
worthless odds and ends. In a locker they
found the ship’s papers. Blood plunged into
these, and announced his discoveries to the
others, crowding behind him and peeping over
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Captain Keene, master&mdash;bound from
Frisco to Sydney with cargo of champagne&mdash;&mdash;. And
what in thunder is she doing
down here? Never mind&mdash;we’re the finders.”
He tossed the papers back in the locker and
turned to the others. “No sign of the log.
Most likely he’s taken it off with him. What
I want to see now is the cargo. If it’s champagne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and not bottled bilge water, we’re
made. Come along, boys.”</p>

<p>He led the way on deck, and between them
they got the tarpaulin cover off the cargo
hatch, undid the locking bars, and opened the
hatch.</p>

<p>The cargo was perfectly stowed, the cases
of California champagne ranged side by side,
within touching distance of the hatch opening,
and the brands on the boxes answering to the
wording of the manifest.</p>

<p>Before doing anything more, Blood got the
sail off the schooner, and then, having cast an
eye round the horizon, more for weather than
shipping, he came to the hatch edge and took
his seat, with his feet dangling and his toes
touching the cases. The others stood while he
talked to them.</p>

<p>“There’s some chaps,” said Blood, “who’d
be for running crooked on this game, taking
the schooner off to some easy port and selling
her and the cargo, but I’m not going to go in
for any such mug’s business as that. Frisco
and salvage money is my idea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what about the <em>Yan-Shan</em>?” asked
Ginnell. “Frisco will be reekin’ with the story
of how Gunderman found us pickin’ her bones
and how he caught us with the dollars in our
hands. Don’t you think the underwriters will
put that up against us? Maybe they won’t say
we’ve murdered the crew of this hooker for
the sake of the salvage! Our characters are
none too bright to be goin’ about with schooners
and cargoes of fizz, askin’ for salvage
money.”</p>

<p>“<em>Your</em> character ain’t,” said Harman.
“Speak for yourself when you’re talkin’ of
characters, and leave us out. I’m with Blood.
I’ve had enough of this shady business, and I
ain’t goin’ to run crooked no more. Frisco
and salvage moneys&mdash;my game, b’sides, you
needn’t come into Frisco harbour. Lend us a
couple of your hands to take her in, and we’ll
do the business and share equal with you in
the takin’s. I ain’t a man to go back on a pal
for a few dirty dollars, and my word’s as good
as my bond all along the water side with pals.
I ain’t sayin’ nothin’ about owners or companies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
I say with pals, and you’ll find your share
banked for you in the Bank of California, safe
as if you’d put it there yourself.”</p>

<p>Ginnell for a moment seemed about to dissent
violently from this proposition; then, of
a sudden, he fell calm.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “maybe I’m wrong and
maybe you’re right, but I ain’t goin’ to hang
behind. If you’ve fixed on taking her into
Frisco, I’ll follow you in and help in the
swearin’. You two chaps can navigate her
with a couple of the coolies I’ll lend you, and,
mind you, it’s equal shares I’m askin’.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Harman. “What do you say,
Blood?”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” said Blood; “though it’s
more than he deserves, considering all things.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not goin’ to put up no arguments,”
said Ginnell. “I states me terms, and,
now that’s fixed, I proposes we takes stock of
the cargo. Rig a tackle and get one of them
cases on deck and let’s see if the manifest holds
when the wrappin’s is off.”</p>

<p>The others agreed. With the help of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
couple of the Chinamen from the boat alongside,
they rigged a tackle and got out a case.
Harman, poking about, produced a chisel and
mallet from the hole where the schooner’s
carpenter had kept his tools, a strip of boarding
was removed from the top of the case,
and next moment a champagne bottle, in its
straw jacket, was in the hands of Ginnell.</p>

<p>“Packed careful,” said he.</p>

<p>He removed the jacket and the pink tissue
paper from the bottle, whose gold capsule glittered
delightfully in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Then he knocked the bottle’s head off, and
the amber wine creamed out over his hands
and onto the deck.</p>

<p>Harman ran to the galley and fetched a pannikin,
and they sampled the stuff, and then
Blood, taking the half-empty bottle, threw it
overboard.</p>

<p>“We don’t want any drinking,” said he;
“and we’ll have to account for every bottle.
Now, then, get the lid fixed again and the case
back in the hold, and let’s see what’s in the
lazaret in the way of provisions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>They got the case back, closed the hatch,
and then started on an inspection of the stores,
finding plenty of stuff in the way of pork and
rice and flour, but no delicacies. There was
not an ounce of tea or coffee, no sugar, no
tobacco.</p>

<p>“They must have took it all with them when
they made off,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“That’s easy mended,” replied Ginnell.
“We can get some stores from the <em>Heart</em>;
s’pose I go off to her and fetch what’s wanted
and leave you two chaps here?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” said Blood; “we all stick
together, Pat Ginnell, and so there’ll be no
monkey tricks played. That’s straight. Get
your fellers into the boat and let’s shove off,
then Harman and I can come back with the
stores and the hands you can lend us to work
her.”</p>

<p>“Faith, you’re all suspicious,” said Ginnell,
with a grin. “Well, over with you, and we’ll
all go back together. I’m gettin’ to feel as if
I was married to you two chaps. However,
there’s no use in grumblin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Blood.</p>

<p>He followed Ginnell into the whaleboat,
and, leaving the <em>Tamalpais</em> to rock alone on
the swell, they made back for the <em>Heart of
Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>Now, Ginnell, although he had agreed to
go back to Frisco, had no inclination to do so,
the fact of the matter being that the place had
become too hot for him.</p>

<p>He had played with smuggling, and had
been friendly with the Greeks of the Upper
Bay and the Chinese of Petaluma. He had
fished with Chinese sturgeon lines, foul inventions
of Satan, as all Chinese sporting, hunting,
and fishing contraptions are, and had fallen
foul of the patrol men; he had lit his path with
blazing drunks as with bonfires, mishandled
his fellow creatures, robbed them, cheated
them, and lied to them. He had talked big
in bars, and the wharf side of San Francisco
was sick of him; so, if you understand the
strength of the wharf-side stomach, you can
form some estimate of the character of Captain
Ginnell. He knew quite well the feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of the harbour side against him, and he knew
quite well how that feeling would be inflated
at the sight of him coming back triumphant,
with a salved schooner in tow. Then there
was Gunderman. He feared Gunderman
more than he feared the devil, and he feared
the story that Gunderman would have to tell
even more than he feared Gunderman.</p>

<p>No, he had done with Frisco; he never
would go back there again; he had done with
the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>. He would strike out
again in life with a new name and a new
schooner and a cargo of champagne, sell
schooner and cargo, and make another start
with still another name.</p>

<p>Revolving this decision in his mind, he
winked at the backs of Blood and Harman as
they went up the little companion ladder before
him and gained the deck of the <em>Heart of
Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>Blood led the way down to the cabin. The
lazaret was situated under the cabin floor, and,
while Harman opened it, Blood, with a pencil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and a bit of paper, figured out their requirements.</p>

<p>“We want a couple of tins of coffee,” said
he, “and half a dozen of condensed milk&mdash;sugar,
biscuits&mdash;tobacco&mdash;beef.”</p>

<p>“It’s sorry I am I haven’t any cigars to offer
you,” said Ginnell, with a half laugh, “but
there’s some tins of sardines; be sure an’ take
the sardines, Mr. Harman, for me heart
wouldn’t be aisy if I didn’t think you were
well supplied with comforts.”</p>

<p>“I can’t find any sardines,” said the delving
Harman, “but here’s baccy enough, and eight
tins of beef will be more than enough to get
us to Frisco.”</p>

<p>“Take a dozen,” said Ginnell; “there ain’t
more than a dozen all told; but, sure, I’ll manage
to do without, and never grumble so long
as you’re well supplied.”</p>

<p>Blood glanced at him with an angry spark
in his eye.</p>

<p>“We’ve no wish to crowd you, Pat Ginnell,”
said he, “and what we take we pay for, or we
will pay for it when we get to port. You’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
please remember you’re talking to an Irishman.”</p>

<p>“Irishman!” cried Ginnell. “You’ll be
plazed to remember I’m an Irishman, too.”</p>

<p>“Well I know it,” replied the other.</p>

<p>This remark, for some unaccountable reason,
seemed to incense Ginnell. He clenched
his fists, stuck out his jaw, glanced Blood up
and down, and then, as if remembering something,
brought himself under control with a
mighty effort.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in talk,” said he; “we’d better
be gettin’ on with our business. You’ll
want somethin’ in the way of a sack to cart all
that stuff off to the schooner. I’ll fetch you
one.”</p>

<p>He turned to the companion ladder and
climbed it in a leisurely fashion. On deck he
took a deep breath and stood for a moment
scanning the horizon from north to south.
Then he turned and cast his eyes over Santa
Catalina and the distant coast line.</p>

<p>Not a sail was visible, nor the faintest indication
of smoke in all that stainless blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
sweeping in a great arc from the northern to
the southern limits of visibility.</p>

<p>No one was present to watch Ginnell and
what he was about to do. No one save God
and the sea gulls&mdash;for Chinese don’t count.</p>

<p>He stepped to the cabin hatch.</p>

<p>“Misther Harman!” cried he.</p>

<p>“Hello!” answered Harman, from below.
“Whacher want?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the Bank of California I want
to speak to you,” replied Ginnell.</p>

<p>Harman’s round and astonished face appeared
at the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>“Bank of California?” said he. “What the
blazes do you mean, Pat Ginnell?”</p>

<p>“Why, you said you’d put me share of the
salvage in the Bank of California, didn’t
you?” replied Ginnell. “Well, I just want
to say I’m agreeable to your proposal&mdash;and
will you be plazed to give the manager me
love when you see him?”</p>

<p>With that he shut the hatch, fastening it
securely and prisoning the two men below,
whose voices came now bearing indications of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
language enough, one might fancy, to lift the
deck. He knew it would take them a day’s
hard work to break out, and maybe two. Bad
as Ginnell might be, he was not a murderer,
and he reckoned their chances were excellent
considering the provisions and water they had,
their own energies, and the drift of the current,
which would take them close up to Santa
Catalina.</p>

<p>He also reckoned that they would give him
no trouble in the way of pursuit, for he had
literally made them a present of the <em>Heart of
Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself that they were well
and securely held, he sent the whaleboat off
to the <em>Tamalpais</em>, laden with the crew’s belongings,
consisting of all sorts of quaint boxes
and mats. This was managed in one journey;
the boat came back for him, and, in less than
an hour from the start of the business, he
found himself standing on the deck of the
<em>Tamalpais</em>, all the crew transferred, the fellows
hauling on the halyards, Chopstick
Charlie at the helm, and a good schooner, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
a cargo worth many thousands of dollars, underfoot.</p>

<p>He turned to have a look at the compass
and a word with the steersman before going
below.</p>

<p>Down below he had a complete turnout of
the Captain’s cabin, and found the log for
which Harman had hunted in vain; it had got
down between the bunk bedding and the panelling,
and he brought it into the main cabin,
and there, seated at the table, he pored over
it, breathing hard and following the passages
with his horny thumb.</p>

<p>The thing had been faked most obviously,
and the faking had begun two days out from
Frisco. A gale that had never blown had
driven the <em>Tamalpais</em> out of her course, et
cetera; and Ginnell, with the eye of a sailor
and with his knowledge of the condition of the
<em>Tamalpais</em> when found, saw at once that there
was something here darker even than the darkness
that Blood and Harman had perceived.
Why had the log been faked? Why had the
schooner been abandoned? If it were a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of insurance, Captain Keene would have
scuttled her or fired her.</p>

<p>Then, again, everything spoke of haste
amounting to panic. Why should a vessel, in
perfect condition and in good weather, be deserted
as though some visible plague had suddenly
appeared on board of her?</p>

<p>Ginnell closed the book and tossed it back
in the bunk.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of it?”</p>

<p>Unhappy man, he was soon to find out.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock next morning, in perfect
weather, Ginnell, standing by the steersman
and casting his eyes around, saw across the
heaving blueness of the sea a smudge of smoke
on the western horizon. A few minutes later,
as the smoke cleared, he made out the form of
the vessel that had been firing up.</p>

<p>Captain Keene had left an old pair of
binoculars among the other truck in his cabin.
Ginnell went down and fetched them on deck,
then he looked.</p>

<p>The stranger was a torpedo boat; she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
making due south, and, like all torpedo boats,
she seemed in a hurry.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, and even as he looked, her
form began to alter, she shortened mysteriously,
and her two funnels became gradually
one.</p>

<p>She had altered her course; she had evidently
sighted, and was making direct for, the
<em>Tamalpais</em>. Not exactly direct, perhaps, but
directly enough to make Ginnell’s lips dry as
sandstone.</p>

<p>“Bad cess to her,” said Ginnell to himself;
“there’s no use in doin’ anythin’ but pretendin’
to be deaf and dumb. And, sure, aren’t I an
honest trader, with all me credentials, Capt’in
Keene, of Frisco, blown out of me course, me
mate washed overboard? Let her come.”</p>

<p>She came without any letting. Shearing
along through the water, across which the hubbub
of her engines could be distinctly heard,
and within signalling distance, now, she let fly
a string of bunting to the breeze, an order to
heave to, which the <em>Tamalpais</em>, that honest
trader, disregarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a puff of white smoke, the boom
of a gun, and a practice shell that raised a
plume of spray a cable length in front of the
schooner, and went off, making ducks and
drakes for miles across the blue sea.</p>

<p>Ginnell rushed to the halyards himself.
Chopstick Charlie, at the wheel, required no
orders, and the <em>Tamalpais</em> came round, with
all her canvas spilling the wind and slatting,
while the warship, stealing along now with
just a ripple at her stern, came gliding past the
stem of the schooner.</p>

<p>They were taking her name, just as a policeman
takes the number of a motor car.</p>

<p>It was a ghastly business. No cheery voice,
with the inquiry: “What’s your name and
where are you bound for?” Just a silent inspection,
and then a dropped boat.</p>

<p>Next moment a lieutenant of the American
navy was coming over the side of the <em>Tamalpais</em>,
to be received by Ginnell.</p>

<p>“Captain Keene?” asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That’s me name,” answered the unfortunate,
who had determined on the rôle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
blustering innocent; “and who are you, to be
boardin’ me like this and firing guns at me?”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;cheek!” said the other,
with a laugh. “A nice dance you’ve led us
since we lost you in that fog.”</p>

<p>“Which fog?” asked the astonished Ginnell.
“Fog! It’s some other ship you’re after, for I
haven’t sighted a fog since leavin’ port.”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up!” said the other.</p>

<p>His men, who had come on board, were busy
with the covering of the main hatch, and he
walked forward, to superintend.</p>

<p>The hatch cover off, they rigged a tackle and
hauled out a case of champagne; four cases
of champagne they brought on deck, and then,
attacking the next layer, they brought out a
case of a different description. It contained a
machine gun.</p>

<p>Under the champagne layer, the <em>Tamalpais</em>
was crammed right down to the garboard
strakes with contraband of war in the form of
arms and ammunition for the small South
American republic that was just then kicking
up a dust around its murdered president.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Ginnell saw his own position at a glance.
The <em>Heart of Ireland</em> given away to Blood
and Harman for the captaincy of a gun runner,
and a seized gun runner at that.</p>

<p>He saw now why Keene and his crew had
deserted in a hurry. Chased by the warship,
and running into a fog, they had slipped away
in the boats, making for the coast, while the
pursuer had made a dead-west run of it to
clear herself of the dangerous coast waters
and their rocks and shoals.</p>

<p>That was plain enough to Ginnell, but the
prospect ahead of him was not clear at all.</p>

<p>He could never confess the truth about the
<em>Heart of Ireland</em>, and, when they took him
back to Frisco, it would at once be discovered
that he was not Keene, but Ginnell. What
would happen to him?</p>

<p>What did happen to him? I don’t know.
Billy Meersam could throw no light on the
matter. He said that he believed the thing
was “hushed up somehow or ’nother,” finishing
with the opinion that a good many things
are hushed up somehow or ’nother in Frisco.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<span class="titlefont">AVALON BAY</span></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Avalon Bay, on the east of Santa Catalina
Island, clips between its two horns a little seaside
town unique of its kind. Billy Harman
had described it to Captain Blood as a place
where you saw girls bathing in Paris hats.
However that may be, you see stranger things
than this at Avalon.</p>

<p>It is the head centre of the big-game fisheries
of the California coast. Men come here
from all parts of America and Europe to kill
tarpon and yellow-tail and black sea bass, to
say nothing of shark, which is reckoned now as
a game fish. Trippers come from Los Angeles
to go round in glass-bottomed boats and
inspect the sea gardens, and bank presidents,
Steel Trust men, and millionaires of every
brand come for their health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>You will see monstrous shark gallowsed on
the beach and three-hundred-pound bass being
photographed side by side with their captors,
and you will have the fact borne in on
you that the biggest fish that haunt the sea can
be caught and held and brought to gaff with a
rod weighing only a few ounces and a twenty-strand
line that a child could snap.</p>

<p>Every one talks fish at Avalon, from the
boatmen who run the gasoline launches to the
latest-arrived man with a nerve breakdown
who has come from the wheat pit or Wall
Street to rest himself by killing sharks or fighting
tuna, every one. Here you are estimated
not by the size of your bank balance, but by
the size of your catch. Not by your social position,
but by your position in sport, and here
the magic blue or red button of the Tuna Club
is a decoration more prized than any foreign
order done in diamonds.</p>

<p>Colonel Culpepper and his daughter, Rose,
were staying at Avalon just at the time the
<em>Yan-Shan</em> business occurred on San Juan.
The colonel hailed from the Middle West and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had a wide reputation on account of his luck
and his millions. Rose had a reputation of
her own; she was reckoned the prettiest girl
wherever she went, and just now she was the
prettiest girl in Avalon.</p>

<p>This morning, just after dawn, Miss Culpepper
was standing on the veranda of the
Metropole Hotel, where the darkies were
dusting mats and putting the cane chairs in
order. Avalon was still half in shadows, but
a gorgeous morning hinted of itself in the blue
sky overhead and the touch of dusk-blue sea
visible from the veranda. The girl had come
down undecided as to whether she would go
on the water or for a ramble inland, but the
peep of blue sea decided her. It was irresistible,
and, leaving the hotel, she came toward
the beach.</p>

<p>No one was out yet. In half an hour or less
the place would be alive with boatmen, but in
this moment of enchantment not a soul was to
be seen either on the premises of the Tuna
Club or on the little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plage</i> or on the shingle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
where the small waves were breaking, crystal
clear, in the first rays of the sun.</p>

<p>She came to a balk of timber lying close to
the water’s edge, stood by it for a moment,
and then sat down, nursing her knees and contemplating
the scene before her&mdash;the sun-smitten
sea looking fresh, as though this were
the first morning that had ever shone on the
world, the white gulls flying against the blue
of the sky, the gasoline launches and sailing
boats anchored out from the shore and only
waiting the boatmen, the gaffers, the men with
rods, and the resumption of the eternal business&mdash;Fish.</p>

<p>The sight of them raised no desire in the
mind of the gazer; she was tired of fish. A
lover of the sea, a fearless sailor and able to
handle a boat as well as a man, she was still
weary of the eternal subject of weights and
measures; she had lived in an atmosphere of
fish for a month, and, not being much of a fisherwoman,
she was beginning to want a change,
or, at all events, some new excitement. She
was to get it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>A crunching of the shingle behind her made
her turn. It was Aransas Joe, the first boatman
out that morning, moving like a seal to
the sea and laden with a huge can of bait, a
spare spar, two sculls, and a gaff.</p>

<p>Anything more unlovely than Aransas Joe
in contrast with the fair morning and the fresh
figure of the girl, it would be hard to imagine.
Wall-eyed, weather-stained, fish-scaled, and
moving like a plantigrade, he was a living
epitome of longshore life and an object lesson
in what it can do for a man.</p>

<p>Joe never went fishing; the beach was his
home, and sculling fishermen to their yawls
his business. The Culpeppers were well
known to him.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said the girl, “you’re just the person
I want. Come and row me out to our yawl.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your gaffer an’ your engine man?”
asked Joe.</p>

<p>“I don’t want them. I can look after the
engine myself. I’m not going fishing.”</p>

<p>“Not goin’ fishin’,” said Joe, putting down
his can of bait and shifting the spar to his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
shoulder; “not goin’ fishin’! Then what d’you
want doin’ with the yawl?”</p>

<p>“I want to go for a sail&mdash;I mean a spin. Go
on, hurry up and get the dinghy down.”</p>

<p>Joe relieved himself of the spar, dropped
the gaff by the bait tin, and scratched his
head. It was his method of thinking.</p>

<p>Unable to scratch up any formulable objection
to the idea of a person taking a fishing
yawl out for pleasure and not for fish, yet
realising the absurdity of it, he was dumb.
Then, with the sculls under his arm, he made
for a dinghy beached near the water edge,
threw the sculls in, and dragged the little boat
down till she was half afloat. The girl got in,
and he pushed off.</p>

<p>The <em>Sunfish</em> was the name of the Culpeppers’
yawl, a handy little craft rigged with a
Buffalo engine so fixed that one could attend
to it and steer at the same time.</p>

<p>“Mind you, and keep clear of the kelp,”
said Joe, as the girl stepped from the dinghy
to the larger craft, “if you don’t want your
propeller tangled up.” He helped her to haul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the anchor in, got into the dinghy, and shoved
off.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back about eight or nine,” she called
after him.</p>

<p>“I’ll be on the lookout for you,” replied he.</p>

<p>Then Miss Culpepper found herself in the
delightful position of being absolutely alone
and her own mistress, captain and crew of a
craft that moved at the turning of a lever, and
able to go where she pleased. She had often
been out with her father, but never alone like
this, and the responsible-irresponsible sensation
was a new delight in life which, until
now, she had never even imagined.</p>

<p>She started the engine, and the <em>Sunfish</em> began
to glide ahead, clearing the fleet of little
boats anchored out and rocking them with her
wash; then, in a grand curve, she came round
the south horn of the bay opening the coast of
the island and the southern sea blue as lazulite
and speckless to the far horizon.</p>

<p>“This is good,” said Miss Culpepper to herself;
“almost as good as being a sea gull.”</p>

<p>Sea gulls raced her, jeered at her, showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
themselves to her, now honey yellow against
the sun, now snowflake white with the sun
against them, and then left her, quarrelling
away down the wind in search of something
more profitable.</p>

<p>She passed little bays where the sea sang on
beaches of pebble, and deep-cut cañons rose-tinted
and showing the green of fern and the
ash green of snake cactus and prickly pear.
Sea lions sunning themselves on a rock held
her eye for a moment, and then, rounding the
south end of the island, a puff of westerly wind
all the way from China blew in her face, and
the vision of the great Pacific opened before
her, with the peaks of San Clemente showing
on the horizon twenty-four miles away to the
southwest.</p>

<p>Not a ship was to be seen, with the exception
of a little schooner to southward. She showed
bare sticks, and Miss Culpepper, not knowing
the depth of the water just there, judged her to
be at anchor.</p>

<p>Here, clear of the island barrier, the vast
and endless swell of the Pacific made itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
felt, lifting the <em>Sunfish</em> with a buoyant and
balloonlike motion. Steering the swift-running
boat across these gentle vales and meadows
of ocean was yet another delight, and the
flying fish, bright like frosted silver, with
black, sightless eyes, chased her now, flittering
into the water ahead of the boat like shaftless
arrowheads shot after her by some invisible
marksman.</p>

<p>The great kelp beds oiled the sea to the
northward, and, remembering Joe’s advice,
but not wishing to return yet a while, the girl
shifted the helm slightly, heading more for
the southward and making a beam sea of the
swell. This brought the schooner in sight.</p>

<p>It was now a little after seven, and the appetite
that waits upon good digestion, youth,
and perfect health began to remind Miss Culpepper
of the breakfast room at the Metropole,
the snow-white tables, the attentive waiters.
She glanced at her gold wrist watch,
glanced round at Santa Catalina, that seemed
a tremendous distance away, and put the helm
hard astarboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not noticed during the last half
minute or so that the engine seemed tired and
irritable. The sudden shift of helm seemed
to upset its temper still more, and then, all of
a sudden, its noise stopped and the propeller
ceased to revolve.</p>

<p>Miss Culpepper, perhaps for the first time
in her life, knew the meaning of the word
“silence.” The silence that spreads from the
Horn to the Yukon, from Mexico to Hongkong,
held off up to this by the beat of the propeller
and the purr of the engine, closed in on
her, broken only by the faint ripple of the bow
wash as the way fell off the boat.</p>

<p>She guessed at once what was the matter,
and confirmed her suspicions by examining the
gasoline gauge. The tank was empty. Aransas
Joe, whose duty it was, had forgotten to fill
it up the night before.</p>

<p>Of all breakdowns this was the worst, but
she did not grumble; the spirit that had raised
Million Dollar Culpepper from nothing to
affluence was not wanting in his daughter.</p>

<p>She said, “Bother!” glanced at Santa Catalina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
glanced at the schooner, and then, stepping
the mast of the yawl, shook out her sail
to the wind. She was steering for the
schooner. It was near, the island was far, and
she reckoned on getting something to eat to
stay her on the long sail back; also, somehow,
the sudden longing for the sight of a human
face and the sound of a human voice in that
awful loneliness on whose fringe she had intruded
had fallen upon her. There were sure
to be sailormen of some sort upon the
schooner, and where there were sailormen
there was sure to be food of some sort.</p>

<p>But there was no one to be seen upon the
deck, and, as she drew closer, the atmosphere
of forsakenness around the little craft became
ever apparent. As she drew closer still she
let go the sheet and furled the sail. So cleverly
had she judged the distance that the boat
had just way enough on to bring it rubbing
against the schooner’s starboard side. She had
cast out the port fenders, and, standing at the
bow with the boat hook, she clutched onto the
after channels, tied up, and then, standing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the yawl’s gunwale, and, with an agility none
the less marked because nobody was looking,
scrambled on board. She had not time to
more than glance at the empty and desolate
deck, for scarcely had her foot touched the
planking when noises came from below.
There were people evidently in the cabin and
they were shouting.</p>

<p>Then she saw that the cabin hatch was
closed, and, not pausing to consider what she
might be letting out, the girl mastered the
working of the hatch fastening, undid it, and
stepped aside.</p>

<p>The fore end of a sailorman emerged, a
broad-faced, blue-eyed individual blinking
against the sunlight. He scrambled on deck,
and was followed by another, dark, better
looking, and younger.</p>

<p>Not a word did these people utter as they
stood taking in everything round them from
the horizon to the girl.</p>

<p>Then the first described brought his eyes to
rest on the girl.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m darned!” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Let me interpolate now Mr. Harman’s part
of the story in his own words.</p>

<p>“When Cap Ginnell bottled me and Blood
in the cabin of the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>,” said he,
“we did a bit of shoutin’ and then fell quiet.
There ain’t no use in shoutin’ against a two-inch
thick cabin hatch overlaid with iron
platin’. He’d made that hatch on purpose for
the bottling of parties; must have, by the way
it worked and by the armamints on it.</p>

<p>“You may say we were mugs to let ourselves
be bottled like that. We were. Y’ see, we
hadn’t thought it over. We hadn’t thought it
would pay Ginnell to abandon the <em>Heart</em> for a
derelick schooner better found and up to her
hatches with a cargo of champagne, or we
wouldn’t have let him fool us down into the
cabin like we did and then clap the hatch on
us. Leavin’ alone the better exchange, we
hadn’t thought it would be nuts to him to do
us in the eye. Mugs we were, and mugs we
found ourselves, sittin’ on the cabin table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
listenin’ to the blighter clearin’ the crew off.
There weren’t no chance of any help from
them. Chows they were, carin’ for nothin’
s’long as their chests an’ opium pipes was safe.</p>

<p>“The skylight overhead was no use for
more’n a cat to crawl through, if it’d been
open, which it wasn’t, more’n an inch, and fastened
from the deck side. Portholes! God
bless you, them scuttles wasn’t big enough for
a cat’s face to fit in.</p>

<p>“I says to Blood: ‘Listen to the blighters!
Oh, say, can’t we do nuthin’, sittin’ here on our
beam ends? Ain’t you got nuthin’ in your
head? Ain’t you got a match in your pocket to
fire the tub and be done with it?’</p>

<p>“‘It’ll be lucky for us,’ says Blood, ‘if Cap
Ginnell doesn’t fire her before he leaves her.’
With that, I didn’t think anythin’ more about
matches. No, sir! For ha’f an hour after the
last boatload of Chows and their dunnage was
off the ship and away I was sniffin’ like a dog
at the hatch cover for the smell of smoke, and
prayin’ to the A’mighty between sniffs.</p>

<p>“After that we rousted round to see how we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
were fixed up for provisions and water. We
found grub enough for a month, and in one of
the bunks a breaker ha’f filled with water.
Now that breaker must have been put there
for us by Ginnell before we left the <em>Heart</em> to
’xamine the derelick schooner. He must have
fixed in his mind to do us in and change ship
right from the first. I remarks on this to
Blood, and then we starts a hunt for tools to
cut our way out of there, findin’ nuthin’ serviceable
but cutlery ware an’ a corkscrew.
Two prong forks and knives wore thin with
usin’ weren’t what we were searchin’ for; a
burglar’s jimmy, blastin’ powder, and a drill
was more in our line, but there weren’t any,
so we just set to with the knives, cuttin’ and
scrubbin’ at the tender parts of the hatch, more
like tryin’ to tickle a girl with iron stays on
her than any useful work, for the plates on
that hatch would ’a’ given sniff to the plates on
a battleship, till I give over and just sat down
on the floor cursin’ Schwab and the Steel
Trusts and Carnegie and Ginnell and the chap
that had forged them plates from the tip of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
hammer to the toe of his boots. ‘Oh, why the
blazes,’ says I, ‘weren’t we born rats! There’s
some sense in rats; rats would be out and on
deck, while here’s two chaps with five fingers
on each fist and men’s brains in their heads
bottled and done for, scratchin’ like blind kittens
shet up in a box, and all along of puttin’
their trust in a swab they ought to have
scragged when they had the chanst.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, shet your head!’ says Blood.</p>

<p>“‘Shet yours,’ says I. ‘I’m speakin’ for both
of us; it’s joining in with that skrimshanker’s
done us. Bad comp’ny, neither more nor
neither less, and I’m blowed if I don’t quit
such and their likes and turn Baptis’ minister
if I ever lay leg ashore again.’ Yes, that’s
what I says to Cap Blood; I was that het up I
laid for everythin’ in sight. Then I goes on at
him for the little we’d done, forgettin’ it was
the tools were at fault. ‘What’s the use,’ says
I, ‘tinkerin’ away at that hatch? You might
as well be puttin’ a blister on a bald head,
hopin’ to raise hair. Here we are, and here
we stick,’ I says, ‘till Providence lets us out.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“The words were scarce out of my head
when he whips out Ginnell’s gun, which he
was carryin’ in his pocket and hadn’t remembered
till then. I thought he was goin’ to lay
for me, till he points the mouth of it at the
hatch and lets blaze. There were three
ca’tridges in the thing, and he fires the three,
and when I’d got back my hearing and the
smoke had cleared a bit there was the hatch
starin’ at us unrattled, with three spelters of
lead markin’ it like beauty spots over the three
dimples left by the bullets.</p>

<p>“All the same, the firin’ done us good&mdash;sort
of cleared the air like a thunder-storm&mdash;and
I began to remember I’d got a mouth on me
and a pipe in my pocket. We lit up and sat
down, him on the last step of the companionway
and me on the table side, and then we began
to figure on what hand Providence was
like to take in the business.</p>

<p>“I says to him: ‘There’s nothin’ <em>but</em> Providence
left, barrin’ them old knives and that
corkscrew, and they’re out of count. We’re
driftin’ on the <em>Kuro Shiwo</em> current, aimin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
right for the Horn, you may say, but there’s
the kelp beds, and they’re pretty sure to hold
us a bit. They’re south of us, and Santa Catalina’s
east of them, with lots of fishin’ boats
sure to be out, and it’s on the cards that some
of them jays will spot us. “Derelick” is writ
all over us&mdash;bare sticks and nothin’ on deck,
and sluin’ about to the current like a drunk
goin’ home in the mornin’.’</p>

<p>“The Cap he cocks his eye up at the telltale
compass fixed on the beam overhead of him.
It cheered him up a bit with its deviations,
and he allowed there might be somethin’ in
the Providence business if the kelp beds only
held good.</p>

<p>“‘Failin’ them,’ he says, ‘it’s the Horn and a
clear sea all the way to it, with the chance of
bein’ passed be day or rammed at night by
some rotten freighter. I don’t know much
about Providence,’ he says, ‘but if you give
me the choice between the two, I’ll take the
kelp beds.’</p>

<p>“Blood hadn’t no more feelin’s for religion
in him than a turkey. He was a book-read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
man, and I’ve took notice that nothin’ shakes
a sailorman in his foundations s’ much as
messin’ with books.</p>

<p>“I don’t say my own religious feelin’s run
equal, but they gets me by the scruff after a jag
and rubs me nose in it, and they lays for me
when I’m lonely, times, with no money or the
chanst of it in sight; times, they’ve near caught
me and made good on the clutch, so’s that if
I’m not bangin’ a drum in the Sa’vation Army
at this present minit it’s only be the mercy of
Providence. I’ve had close shaves, bein’ a
man of natural feelin’s, of all the traps laid for
such, but Blood he held his own course, and
not bein’ able to see that the kelp beds might
have been put there by Providence to hold us
a bit&mdash;which they were&mdash;and give us a chanst
of bein’ overhauled before makin’ a long board
for the Horn and sure damnation, I didn’t
set out to ’lighten him.</p>

<p>“Well, folks, that day passed somehow or
nuther, us takin’ spells at the hatch to put in
the time. Blood he found a spare ca’tridge of
Ginnell’s, and the thought came to him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
scrape a hole at the foot of the hatch cover
and use the ca’tridge for a blastin’ charge.
The corkscrew came in handy for this, and
toward night he’d got the thing fixed. ‘Now,’
says he, ‘you’ll see somethin’!’ And he up
with the revolver and hit the ca’tridge a belt
with the butt end, and the durned thing backfires
and near blew his head off.</p>

<p>“After that we lit the cabin lamp and had
supper and went asleep, and early next mornin’
I was woke by the noise of a boat comin’
alongside. I sat up and shook Blood, and we
listened.</p>

<p>“Then we began to shout and bang on the
hatch, and all at once the fastening went, and
all at once the sun blazed on us, and next minit
I was on deck, with Blood after me. Now
what d’you think had let us out? I’ll give you
twenty shots and lay you a dollar you don’t
hit the bull’s-eye. A girl! That’s what had
let us out. Dressed in white, she were, with a
panama on her head and a gold watch on her
wrist and white shoes on her feet and a smile
on her face like the sun dazzle on water. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
pretty! Well, I guess I’m no beauty-show
judge, and my eyes had lit on nothin’ prettier
than Ginnell since leavin’ Frisco, so I may
have been out of my reckonin’ on points of
beauty, but she were pretty. Lord love me, I
never want to see nothin’ prettier! I let out
an oath, I was that shook up at the sight of her,
and Blood he hit me a drive in the back that
nigh sent me into her arms, and then we settled
down and explained matters.</p>

<p>“She was out from Avalon in a motor boat,
and she’d run short of spirit and sailed up to
us, thinkin’ we were at anchor. Providence!
I should think so! Providence and the kelp
beds, for only for them we’d have been twenty
miles to the s’uth’ard, driftin’ to Hades like
hutched badgers on a mill stream. We told
her how Ginnell had fixed us, and she told us
how the gasoline had fixed her. ‘And now,’
says she, ‘will you give me a biskit, for I’m
hungry and I wants to get back to Avalon,
where my poppa is waitin’ for me, and he’ll
be gettin’ narvous,’ she says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Lord love you,’ says I, ‘and how do you
propose to get back?’</p>

<p>“For the wind had fallen a dead ca’m, and
right to Catalina and over to San Clemente
the sea lay like plate glass, with the <em>Kuro
Shiwo</em> flowin’ under like a blue satin snake.</p>

<p>“She bit on her lip, but she was all sand,
that girl&mdash;Culpepper were her name&mdash;and not
a word did she say for a minit. Then she says,
aimin’ to be cheerful: ‘Well, I suppose,’ says
she, ‘we’ll just have to stay at anchor here till
they fetch me or the wind comes.’</p>

<p>“‘Anchor!’ said I. ‘Why, Lord bless you,
there’s a mile-deep water under us! We’re
driftin’.’</p>

<p>“‘Driftin’!’ she cries. ‘And where are we
driftin’ to?’</p>

<p>“That fetched me, and I was hangin’ in irons
when Blood chipped in and cheered her up
with lies and told me to stay with her whiles
he went down below and got some breakfast
ready, and then I was left alone with her,
trustin’ in Providence she wouldn’t ask no
more questions as to where we were driftin’ to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“She sat on the cargo hatch whiles I filled
a pipe, lookin’ round about her like a cat in a
new house, and then she got mighty chummy.
I don’t know how she worked it, but in ten
minits she’d got all about myself out of me
and all about Ginnell and Blood and the <em>Yan-Shan</em>
and the dollars we’d missed; she’d
learned that I never was married and who was
me father and why I went to sea at first start.
Right down to the colour of me first pair of
pants she had it all out of me. She was a
sure-enough lady, but I reckon she missed her
vocation in not bein’ a bilge pump. Then she
heaves a sigh at the sound of ham frying down
below, and hoped that breakfast was near
ready, and right on her words Blood hailed
us from below.</p>

<p>“He’d opened the skylight wide and
knocked the stuffiness out of the cabin, and
down we sat at the table with fried ham and
ship’s bread and coffee before us.</p>

<p>“I’d never set at table with the likes of her
before, but if every real lady’s cut on her bias,
I wouldn’t mind settin’ at table with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
every day in me life. There was only two
knives left whole after our practice on the
hatch with them. Blood and she had the
whole ones, and I made out with a stump, but
she didn’t mind nor take notice. She was
talkin’ away all the time she was stuffin’ herself,
pitchin’ into Cap Ginnell just like one
of us. Oh, I guess if she’d been a man she’d
have swore worth listenin’ to; she had the
turn of the tongue for the work, and what she
said about Ginnell might have been said in
chapel without makin’ parties raise a hair,
but I reckon it’d have raised blisters on the
soul of Pat Ginnell if he’d been by to hear
and if he’d a soul to blister, which he hasn’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harman relit his pipe, and seemed for
a moment absorbed in contemplation of Miss
Culpepper and her possibilities as a plain
speaker; then he resumed:</p>

<p>“She made us tell her all over again about
the <em>Yan-Shan</em> business and the dollars, and
she allowed we were down on our luck, and
she put her finger on the spot. Said she: ‘You
fell through by not goin’ on treatin’ Ginnell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
as you begun treatin’ him. If he was bad
enough to be used that way, he wasn’t even
good enough for you to make friends with.’
Them wasn’t her words, but it was her
meanin’.</p>

<p>“Then we left her to make her t’ilet with
Blood’s comb and brush, tellin’ her she could
have the cabin to herself as long as she was
aboard, and, ten minutes after, she was on
deck again, bright as a new pin, and scarce
had she stuck her head into the sun than
Blood, who was aft, dealin’ with some old
truck, shouts: ‘Here’s the wind!’</p>

<p>“It was coming up from s’uth’ard like a
field of blue barley, and I took the wheel, and
Blood and her ran to the halyards. She
hauled like a good un, and the old <em>Heart</em>
sniffed and shook at the breeze, and I tell you
it livened me up again to feel the kick of the
wheel. We’d got the motor boat streamed
astern on a line, and then I gave the old <em>Heart</em>
the helm, and round she came, so that in a
minit we were headin’ for Santa Catalina hull
down on the horizon and only her spars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
showin’, so to speak. I thought that girl
would ’a’ gone mad. Not at the chanst of gettin’
back, but just from the pleasure of feelin’
herself on a live ship and helpin’ to handle
her. I let her have the wheel, and she steered
good, and all the time Santa Catalina was
liftin’, and now we could see with the glass
that the water all round the south end was
thick with boats.</p>

<p>“‘They’re huntin’ for me,’ said she. ‘I
guess poppa is in one of them boats,’ she says,
‘and won’t he be surprised when he finds I
ain’t drowned? Your fortunes is made,’ says
she, ‘for pop owns the ha’f of Minneapolis,
and I guess he’ll give you ha’f of what he owns.
<em>You</em> wait till you hear the yarn I’ll sling
him&mdash;&mdash;. Here they come!’</p>

<p>“They sighted us, and ha’f a hundred gasoline
launches were nose end on for us, fanning
out like a regatta, and in the leadin’
launch sat an old chap with white whiskers
and a fifty-dollar panama on his head.</p>

<p>“‘That’s pop,’ she said.</p>

<p>“He were, and we hove to, whiles he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
climbin’ on board like a turtle, one leg over
the bulwarks and one arm round her neck, and
then up went a hallelujah chorus from that
crowd of craft round us, women wavin’ handkerchiefs
and blowin’ their noses and blubbing
nuff to make a camel sick.</p>

<p>“Then he and she went down to the cabin
to make explanashions, and the parties in the
boats tried to board us, till I threatened them
with a boat hook and made them fend off
while we got way on the <em>Heart</em>.</p>

<p>“When we were near into Avalon Bay, the
Culps came on deck, and old man Culpepper
took off his hat to me and Blood and made us
a speech, sayin’ we’d lifted weights off his
heart, and all such.</p>

<p>“‘Never mind,’ says Blood, ‘we haven’t
done nuthin’. Put it all down to Providence,’
says he, ‘for if we saved her she saved us, and
I ain’t used to bein’ thanked for nothin’.’</p>

<p>“But, Lord bless you, you might as well
have tried to stop the Mississippi in flood as
that old party when he’d got his thank gates
up. He said we were an honour to merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
seamen, which we weren’t, and the great
American nation&mdash;and Blood black Irish and
me Welsh, with an uncle that was a Dutchman&mdash;and
then I’m blest if he didn’t burst into
po’try about the flag that waves over us all.</p>

<p>“It began to look like ten thousand dollars
in gold coin for each of us, and more than like
it when we’d dropped anchor in the bay and
he told us to come ashore with him.</p>

<p>“Now I don’t know how longshore folk<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
have such sharp noses, but I do know them
longshore boatmen on Avalon Beach seemed
to know by the cut of the <em>Heart</em> and us we
weren’t no simple seamen, with flags wavin’
over us and an honour to our what-you-call-it
navy. They sniffed at us by some instinct
or other, more special a wall-eyed kangaroo
by the name of Aransas Jim, I think it were.</p>

<p>“Said nothin’ much, seein’ old man Culp
was disembarkin’ us with an arm round each
of our necks, so to say, but we took up their
looks, and I’d to lay pretty strong holts on
myself or I’d have biffed the blighters, lot
o’ screw-neck mongrels, so’s their mothers
wouldn’t have known which was which when
sortin’ the manglin’.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>“Now you listen to what happened then.
Culp he took us up to a big hotel, where
niggers served us with a feed in a room by
ourselves. Champagne they give us, and all
sorts of truck <em>I’d</em> never set eyes on before.
And when it was over in came old man Culp
with an envelope in his hand, which he gives
to Blood.</p>

<p>“‘Just a few dollars for you and your mate,’
says he, ‘and you have my regards always.’</p>

<p>“The girl she came in and near kissed us,
and off we went with big cigars in our mouths,
feelin’ we were made men. The longshoremen
were still on the beach scratchin’ the fleas
off themselves and talkin’, I expec’, of the next
millionaire they could rob by pretendin’ to
be fishermen. Blood he picked up a pebble
on the shingle and put it in his pocket, and
when the longshore louts saw us comin’,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
smokin’ cigars and walkin’ arrogant, they
made sure old man Culp had given us ha’f a
million, and they looked it. All them noses
of theirs weren’t turned up just now. They
saw dollars comin’ and hoped for a share.</p>

<p>“‘Here, you chap,’ says Blood to Aransas
Jim or Aransas Joe or whichever was his
name, ‘help us to push our boat off and I’ll
make it worth your while.’ The chap does,
and wades after us, when we were afloat, for
his dues. He held out his hand, and Blood
he clapped the pebble into it, and off we shot
with them helaballoing after us.</p>

<p>“Much we cared.</p>

<p>“On board the <em>Heart</em>, we tumbled down to
the cabin to ’xamine our luck. Blood takes
the envelope from his pocket, slits it open,
and takes out a little check that was in it. How
much for, d’you think? Five thousand dollars?
No, it weren’t.</p>

<p>“Twenty dollars was writ on it. Twenty
dollars, no cents.</p>

<p>“‘Say, Blood,’ says I to him, ‘you’ve got
the pebble this time.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blood he folded the check up and lit his
pipe with it. Then he says, talkin’ in a satisfied
manner ’s if to himself:</p>

<p>“‘It were worth it.’</p>

<p>“That’s all he said. And, comin’ to think
of it now meself, it were.”</p>

<h2>V<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE BIG HAUL</span></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Captain Michael Blood and Billy Harman,
having received ten thousand dollars for
services rendered to Henry Clay Armbruster,
and having cashed the check, held a consultation
as to what they should do with it.</p>

<p>Harman was for filling up their schooner,
the <em>Heart of Ireland</em>, with trade and starting
off for the islands in search of copra. Blood,
tired of the sea, for a while demurred. He
said he wanted to enjoy life a bit.</p>

<p>“And who’s to stop you?” replied the open-minded
Harman. “A thousand dollars is all
we want for a bust, and a week to do it in.
I’ve took notice that the heart is mostly out of
a bust by the end of a week, after that it’s a
fair wind and followin’ sea for the jimjams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
with an empty hold when you fetches them.
Let’s lay our plans and work cautious, for,
when all’s said and done, it’s no great shakes
to wake jailed with empty pockets, robbed of
your boots by the bar drummers you’ve been
fillin’ with booze.</p>

<p>“Booze ain’t no use,” continued Mr. Harman,
finishing his glass&mdash;they were celebrating
the occasion in a bar near the China docks.
“Look at the chaps that sell it, and look at the
chaps that swallow it&mdash;one lot covered with
di’monds and the other lot with their toes
stickin’ out of their boots. We’ve got to work
cautious and keep takin’ soundings all the
time, for riches is rocks, as I heard a chap
once sayin’ in a temp’rance meetin’ on the
Sand Lot. Twenty year ago it was, but the
sayin’ stuck in my head&mdash;have another?”</p>

<p>They failed to “work cautious” that night.
Flushed with prosperity and unaccustomed
drinks, they found themselves playing cards
with professional gamblers, who relieved
them of five thousand dollars in an hour and
twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Riches is rocks.” There was never a truer
saying; and next morning, not being altogether
fools, they determined to thank God
the whole of their little fortune was not gone
and to set to work to retrieve their losses.</p>

<p>Now, it had become known all about the
waterside that the <em>Heart of Ireland</em> was back.
The fate of Ginnell, her original owner, who
had been jugged for gun running, was still
fresh and pleasant in the mind of the public;
and the authorities, who boarded the <em>Heart</em> on
the morning after the gambling adventures of
Blood and Harman, would have had a lot of
things to say to those two had not Harman
already made things straight with the “Clancy
crowd,” that amiable political ring whose
freemasonic friendship and protection was
never invoked in vain by even the least of its
members. So it came about that after friendly
conversation and cigars the authorities rowed
off, and scarcely had they gone when a boat
with a big, fat man in the stern came sculling
up.</p>

<p>“That’s Mike Rafferty,” said Harman to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
companion. “He’s a cousin of Ginnell’s.
Now what in the nation does he want with
us?”</p>

<p>Rafferty hailed Harman by name and came
aboard. Rafferty knew everything about
them, from the fact that they were flush of
coin to the fact that they were in a kind of
lawful-unlawful possession of his cousin’s
schooner.</p>

<p>He talked quite openly on these matters,
but of the fate of his Cousin Ginnell he said
nothing, with the exception of a dark hint
that wires were being pulled in his favour.</p>

<p>Harman was equally explicit.</p>

<p>“He jugged us in the cabin of this ship,”
said Harman, “and made off on the derelick
we struck down the coast there; he gave us a
present of her. That we stick to, and if I ever
lay hands on Pat Ginnell I’ll give him a present
that’ll stick to him for the rest of his
nacheral.”</p>

<p>“Aisy, now,” said Rafferty; “don’t be losin’
your hair. I know the swab, and, though I’m
workin’ in his favour, bein’ cousins, I’ve me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
own down on him. He sold me a pup over the
last cargo of oil he brought in, and if it wasn’t
for the disgrace of the family I’d l’ave him lie
without raisin’ a finger to better him. What
I’ve come about is bizness. I hear you’ve been
talkin’ of copra.”</p>

<p>Harman had, in various bars, and he made
no trouble about admitting the soft impeachment.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Rafferty, “it’s become a poor
business, what with them Germans and missionaries
and such. You go to any of the
islands with trade, and see what you’ll get.
I’ve worked the Pacific since I was a boy the
height of me knee, and I know it. There’s
not an island, nearly, I’m not acqueented with,
not a reef, begob; you ask any one, and they’ll
tell you.”</p>

<p>Harman knew this to be a fact. Rafferty,
who was no good age, had been engaged in
blackbirding, in copra, in opium smuggling,
in all the in-and-out ways of life that the blue
Pacific held or holds open to man.</p>

<p>“Heave ahead,” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Rafferty, “this is me bizness
with you. Pay me fifty dollars down and ten
per cent of the takin’s, and I’ll put you on to
an island where you’ll fill up with copra for a
few old beads and baccy pipes. It’s a vargin
island out of trade tracks; you won’t find any
Dutchman there, and the Kanaka girls come
dancin’ round you with nuthin’ on them but
flowers. You won’t find any Bibles nor crinolines
sp’ilin’ the people there. I marked it
down last year when I was comin’ up from
south of the line, with a never-mind cargo.
But I left the sea last spring, as maybe you
know, else I’d have taken a ship down there
meself. Fifty dollars down and ten per cint
on the takin’s, and I’ll put you on the spot.”</p>

<p>Harman begged time to consider the matter,
and Rafferty, after drinks and conversation of
a political nature, took his departure, leaving
his address behind.</p>

<p>“Now, you see how crookedness don’t pay,”
said Harman, as he watched the boat row off.
“Pat Ginnell was so good at bestin’ he bested
his own relations. I remember that bizness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
about the shark oil; Rafferty was givin’ Ginnell
his name over it in every bar in Frisco,
and now Rafferty’s spoilin’ to get his own back
by usin’ the <em>Heart</em>. Funny them Irish are, for
he’s tryin’ with the other hand to get him clear
of jail for the sake of the family. Jail’s hell
to an Irishman. I’ve always took notice of
that&mdash;no offence to you.”</p>

<p>Blood looked away over the blue waters of
the bay. “It is,” said he, “and, bad as I hate
Ginnell, if I could turn the lock to let him out,
I’d do it to-morrow&mdash;and scrag him the moment
after. Jail’s not natural to a man. If
a man’s not fit to live loose, kill him, if you
want to; if you want to make him afraid of
the law, cut the skin off him with a cat-o’-nine-tails,
but to stick him in a cage&mdash;and what’s
jail but a cage?&mdash;is to turn him into a brute
beast. And it never betters him.”</p>

<p>Harman concurred. Sailors have a way of
getting at the truth of things because they are
always so close to them; and these two, discussing
penal matters on the deck of the <em>Heart
of Ireland</em>, might have been listened to with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
advantage by some of the law officers of the
nations.</p>

<p>Then they had drinks, and later in the day
they called on Rafferty at his office in Ginnis
Street.</p>

<p>They had come to the decision to take his
offer. A soft island was well worth paying
for. Cayzer, the owner of the great Clan line
of steamers, made his fortune by knowing
where to send his ships for cargo, and, though
Harman knew nothing of the owner of the
Clan line, he was keenly alive to the truth of
this matter.</p>

<p>“So you’ve come to agree with me,” said
Rafferty. “Well, you won’t be sorry. Now,
how will you take it&mdash;fifty dollars down and
a ten-per-cent royalty to me on the takin’s, or
would you sooner make a clean deal and pay
me a hundred and fifty down and no royalties?
For between you and me there’s a lot of sea
chances to be taken and the old <em>Heart</em> is not as
young as she used to be.”</p>

<p>Blood and Harman took a walk outside to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
consult, and determined to make a “clean
deal.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be payin’ no royalties,” said
Harman; “let’s cut clear of the chap and pay
him a hundred down; he’ll take it.”</p>

<p>He did, after an hour’s bargaining and
wrangling and calling the saints to observe
how he was being cheated.</p>

<p>Then, the hundred dollars haring been
paid, he gave them the location of the island
on the chart which Harman had brought.</p>

<p>To be almost precise, the island was situated
in the great quadrilateral of empty sea southwest
of Honolulu, bounded by the International
Date Line to westward, latitude 10°
north to southward, longitude 165° to eastward,
and the Tropic of Cancer to northward.</p>

<p>Having paid a hundred dollars for the information,
Blood and Harman left Rafferty’s
office and that very afternoon began to purchase
the trade for their new venture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A fortnight later, with a full Chinese crew
and Harman at the helm, the <em>Heart</em> shook out
her old sails, and, picking her anchor out of
the mud, lay over on a tack that would take
her midway between Alcatras and Bird Rock.
It was a bright and lovely morning, with a
west wind blowing, and Harman whistled
softly to himself as he shifted the helm under
Alcatras and the slatting sails filled on the tack
for Black Point. She was catching the full
breath of the sea here and heeled with the
green water a foot from the starboard gunwale
as she made the reach for <a id="Ref_292"></a>Lime Point, then on
the port tack she felt the first Pacific sea, taking
the middle channel.</p>

<p>After fighting the tumble of the thirty-six-foot
water of the bar, Harman, having set
their course, relinquished the wheel to one of
the Chinamen and joined Blood.</p>

<p>In buying the trade, they had received some
tips from Rafferty. “Now,” said that gentleman,
“there’s no use in takin’ hats to Paris or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
coals to Newcastle. If you’re going to trade
with a place, you must take the things that’s
wanted there. I was sayin’ you could get all
the copra you wanted for baccy pipes and
beads&mdash;that was only me figure of speech.
Them chaps on Matao&mdash;the name of the island&mdash;want
stuff different from that, I took note
when I was there, thinkin’ to trade some time
with them. They’re no end keen on diggin’
the land and growin’ things, and they traded
me a lot of fish and shells for a packet of onion
seed. They want stuff that’s not grown there
natural&mdash;onions, potatoes, and garden seed in
general. You might take some spades and
wheelbarras and not be amiss; and tinware,
pots, and pans, and so on.”</p>

<p>Harman took this useful tip, and the <em>Heart</em>
was well provisioned with things useful in
the way of agriculture. He was talking now
with Blood on the stowage; the wheelbarrows
were exercising his mind, for there is nothing
more awkward to stow, or, in its way, more
likely to be damaged, and they had seven of
them. It was a feature of Harman’s make-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that he sometimes didn’t begin to bother about
things till it was impossible to put them right,
and Blood hinted so in plain language.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of talkin’ about it now?”
said he. “We worked the thing out ashore,
and what’s done is done. You got them cheap,
and if the Kanakas don’t take to them they’ll
always fetch their price in any port.”</p>

<p>“That’s what’s bothering me,” said Harman;
“for if the Kanakas don’t want them and
we fill up with copra, we’ll have to dump the
durned things, for we won’t have stowage
room for them.”</p>

<p>“Wait till we’ve got the copra,” replied
Blood.</p>

<p>Then they stood watching the Californian
coast getting low down on the port quarter
and a big tank steamer pounding along half a
mile away making to enter the gates.</p>

<p>“Wheelbarrows or no wheelbarrows, you
may thank your God you’re not second mate
on <em>that</em>,” said Blood.</p>

<p>Harman concurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>They had favourable winds to south of Bird
Island, which is situated north of Nilihau and
Kaula in the Hawaiian group, then came a
calm that lasted three days, leaving the old
<em>Heart</em> groaning and whining to the lift of the
swell and the grumbling of Harman, hungry
for copra.</p>

<p>“There’s somethin’ about this tub that gets
me,” said he. “Somethin’ always happens just
as we’re about to make good. I believe Pat
Ginnell’s put a curse on her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, close up!” said Blood. “How about
Armbruster? I reckon she’s lucky enough;
it’s the fools that are in her that have brought
any bad luck there’s been going.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” replied the other.</p>

<p>As if to disprove his words, an hour later
the wind came; and three days later, nosing
through the great desolation of blue water between
Sejetman Reef and Johnston Island, the
<em>Heart of Ireland</em> raised the island. It was
midday when the sea-birdlike cry of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Chinamen on the lookout brought Blood and
Harman tumbling up from the cabin. Yes,
it was the island, right enough, and Harman
through his glass could make out the tops of
palm trees where the sea shimmered.</p>

<p>He held the glass glued to his eye for a moment,
and then handed it to Harman.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said he, “the pa’ms is as plentiful
there as the hairs on a bald man’s head.
Why, there ain’t any pa’ms!”</p>

<p>Blood swore and closed the glass with a
snap.</p>

<p>Even at that distance the poverty of the
place in copra shouted across the sea, but it
was not till they had drawn in within sound of
the reefs that the true desolation of this fortunate
island became apparent.</p>

<p>The place was horrible. A mile and a half,
or maybe two miles, long by a mile broad, protected
by broken reefs, the island showed just
one grove of maybe a hundred trees; the rest
was scrub vegetation and sea birds.</p>

<p>Strangest and perhaps most desolate of all
the features was a line of shanties, half protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
by the trees, shanties that seemed gone
to decay.</p>

<p>Then, as the <em>Heart</em> hove to and lay sniffing
at the place, appeared a figure. A man was
coming down the little strip of beach leading
from the shanties to the lagoon.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Harman. “He’s pushin’ off
to us in a boat. Say, Blood, d’you see any
naked Kanaka girls crowned with flowers
waitin’ to dance round us?”</p>

<p>“Rafferty’s sold us a pup,” said Blood.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to be seen. We’ll wait. Let’s
see.”</p>

<p>The boat, a small one, was clearing the reef,
opening and making toward them, the man
sculling her looking over his shoulder now
and then to correct his course.</p>

<p>Close up, she revealed herself as an old fishing
dinghy, battered with wear.</p>

<p>Alongside, the man in her laid in his oars,
caught the rope flung to him by Harman, and
made fast.</p>

<p>He was a pale-faced, lantern-jawed, dyspeptic-looking
person, and he was chewing, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the first thing he did after scrambling on deck
was to spit overboard. The next was to ask a
question.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” said he, saluting the
afterguard with a nod, and sweeping the deck
with his eyes&mdash;eyes like the wine-coloured,
large, soulless eyes of a hare.</p>

<p>“<em>Heart of Ireland</em>, out of Frisco&mdash;what’s
yours?” replied Harman.</p>

<p>“Gadgett,” replied the hare-eyed man. “I
came out thinking maybe you were bringing
news of my schooner, the <em>Bertha Mason</em>.
She’s overdue from Sydney. I’m owner here.
This island’s mine, leased from the Australian
government.” Then, with another look round
the deck: “What in the nation are you doing
down here anyway?”</p>

<p>“Makin’ fools of ourselves,” replied Harman,
“unless we’ve mistook your place for a
big copra island that ought to lay in your position.
You haven’t heard tell of such an island
hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Look at your charts,” said Gadgett. “This
place is only marked on the last British Admiralty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
charts. There’s nothing round here
but water from the Change Time Line to
Johnston Island. You’ve come a thousand
miles out for copra.”</p>

<p>“What’s your venture here, may I ask?”
put in Blood.</p>

<p>“Shell,” replied Gadgett, leaning now
against the starboard rail and cutting himself
a new plug of tobacco. “I’ve been working
this island six years, and had her nearly
stripped of shell last spring, but I’ve hung on
to clear the last of it. There isn’t much, but
I thought I’d take the last squeeze. My
schooner is overdue, and when it comes I’m
going to clear out for good.”</p>

<p>“Say,” said Harman, “did a chap called
Rafferty call here last spring?”</p>

<p>Gadgett turned his eyes to Harman.</p>

<p>“Yes, a chap by that name was here in a
schooner. I’ve forgot her name. Blown out
of his course by weather, he was, and called
for water.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, listen,” said Harman. Then
he told the whole story we know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Gadgett was a good listener. You could
feel him putting his hands into the pockets of
the yarn, so to speak, and weighing the contents,
nodding his head the while, but not saying
a word. When it was finished, he took
from his pocket the knife with which he had
cut the tobacco, opened it, and began cutting
gently at his left thumb nail.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “it’s pretty clear you two
gentlemen have been sold. Brought wheelbarrows
here and onion seed and pots and
pans; might as well have brought an empty
hold for all the trade to be done in this place,
for when I’m gone, with the few Kanakas I
have with me&mdash;they are fishing over on the
other side just now&mdash;there’ll be nobody here
but sea gulls. Rafferty&mdash;I see him clear&mdash;a
big-featured man he was, a questioning chap,
too. Well, there’s no doubt about it; he slung
you a yarn. But what made him do it?”</p>

<p>“What made him do it!” said Blood.
“Why, to guy us all over Frisco and to get
right with us over a deal we had with a cousin
of his by the name of Pat Ginnell. I’m Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
myself, and I ought to have known how they
stick together. No matter, there’s no use in
crying over spilt milk. Can we come into
your lagoon for a brush-up?”</p>

<p>Gadgett assented. There was a broad fairway,
and he steered the <em>Heart</em> himself, the
boat following streamed on a line. When the
anchor was down, he asked them ashore, and
as they were rowing across to the beach said
Gadgett: “Do you gentlemen know anything
of oyster fishing&mdash;shell?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harman.</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” said Gadgett, “for if you’d
been disposed and knew the business you
might have cared to stick here. I put down
spat this spring on the whole floor of this lagoon,
and the place will be thick with oysters
by Christmas. I’d have sold you the remains
of the lease&mdash;over forty years to run&mdash;for a
trifle. There’s money to be made here&mdash;if you
cared to take the thing on.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harman, rather shortly.
“We’re not open to any trade of that sort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, there was no harm in mentioning it,”
said Gadgett.</p>

<p>He took them up to the frame house in the
cocoanut grove, where he lived, and stood
drinks. Then he showed them the godown
where shell was stored and the Kanakas’
shanties.</p>

<p>Then Blood and Harman went off for a
walk by themselves to explore the horrible
desolation of the place.</p>

<p>Said Harman, when they were alone:
“Skunk&mdash;he’s been tryin’ to do us, him and his
spat! I know all about oysters, shell and
pearl. Why, this place won’t be no use for
another fifty years after the way he’s scraped
it. He looks on us as a pair of mugs, wanderin’
about with a cargo of wheelbarrows&mdash;which
we are. But we ain’t such mugs as to
pay him good money for lyin’ yarns.”</p>

<p>They walked to the only eminence on the
island, a rise of ground some hundred feet
above the sea level, and there they stood
breathing the sea air and watching the gulls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and listening to the eternal song of the surf on
the reef.</p>

<p>Then they came back to the beach and
hailed the schooner for a boat, which presently
put off and took them on board.</p>

<p>Once on deck, Mr. Harman made a dive
below into the cabin, and Blood, following
him, found him in the act of uncorking a bottle
of whisky.</p>

<p>“I’m fair let down,” said Harman, mixing
his drink. “It’s not Rafferty, nor the dog’s
trick he’s played us, nor the sight of this
blasted place that’s enough to give a dromedary
the collywobbles. It’s that chap with
the yalla eyes. I heard him laffin’ to himself
when he went into the house, laffin’ at us. I’ve
never been laffed at like that, but it’s not so
much that as the chap. He’s onnatural.”</p>

<p>“I want to get back to Frisco and scrag
Rafferty,” said Blood, taking hold of the bottle.
“That’s all <em>I</em> want.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to scrag the whole of Frisco,
then,” said Harman, “for the place is rockin’
with laughter now, from the China docks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Meiggs’. It’s the wheelbarrows that have
done us; they’ll be had against us everywhere,
and not a bar you’ll go into but you’ll be
asked: Is your wheelbarrow outside? I
don’t want to go back to Frisco, I tell you I
don’t. I want to get to some place where I
can sit down and cuss quiet. Lord, but that
chap has had us lively!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of that fact. Rafferty,
with that fatal sense of humour for which he
had a reputation of a sort, had well avenged
his kinsman, Ginnell, put a hundred dollars
into his own pocket, and made Blood and
Harman forever ridiculous to a certain order
of minds. And his whole working material
had been just the recollection of this forsaken
island&mdash;nothing more than that.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Gadgett’s schooner, the <em>Bertha Mason</em>,
came into the lagoon that night under a full
moon lifting in the east. Blood and Harman
had not gone to bed, and they were treated to
a lovely sight which left them unimpressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could be more perfect in the way
of a sea picture than the schooner fresh from
the sea spilling her amber light on her water
shadows to the slatting of curves and the
sounds of block and cordage, moving like a
vision with just way enough on her to take her
to her anchorage.</p>

<p>Then the lagoon surface reeled to the splash
of the anchor, the shore echoes answered to the
rumble-tum-tum-tum of the chain, and the
<em>Bertha Mason</em> swung to her moorings, presenting
her bow to the outward-going current
and her broadside to that of the <em>Heart</em>.</p>

<p>“Blast the blighters!” said Harman. Then
the two went below to their bunks.</p>

<p>Next morning there were salutations across
the water from one schooner to the other. The
fellows on the <em>Bertha Mason</em> were at work
early getting the shell on board, and the
Chinese crew of the <em>Heart</em> were busy fishing.
During the day there was little communication
between the two vessels, and at night there
was no offer of the Bertha Masonites to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
aboard, yet it was their duty to pay first call
as the <em>Heart</em> was a visitor.</p>

<p>“They’re a stand-off lot,” said Harman.
“They’re turnin’ up their noses. I s’pose, because
we have a crew of chinkies. Well, they
can keep to themselves, for all I care.
When’re we goin’ to put out?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to leave before them,” said
Blood. “Besides, there are repairs to be done,
and we want to fill up with water. They
won’t keep us long.”</p>

<p>Harman said nothing. He wanted to be off,
but he felt as Blood did; his enmity against
the Gadgett crowd made him want to hold on,
pretending to care nothing, and that enmity
was increased next morning. The <em>Bertha
Mason</em>, dragging her anchor a bit on the
strong incoming current, came near to foul the
<em>Heart</em>. Hartman used language to which
came a polite inquiry as to how he was off for
wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>“Gadgett’s told,” said he to Blood, after
making suitable answer to the query.
“They’re laffin at us. The yarn will be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
over Sydney now; they’ll be tellin’ it in N’
York before they’ve done with it. We’ll have
to change our names and sink the <em>Heart</em> to
clear ourselves. Well, I’m goin’ off fishin’.
Gadgett said there was good fishin’ from the
rocks on the other side of the island. I can’t
stick here doin’ nuthin’. The deck’s burnin’
my feet.”</p>

<p>He rowed ashore with lines and fish that
the Chinese had caught for bait. It was five
o’clock in the evening, and the <em>Bertha Mason</em>,
her cargo stowed, was preparing to leave when
he returned.</p>

<p>Blood was down below when Harman came
tumbling down the companionway. He was
flushed, and looked as though he had been
drinking, though his legs were steady enough,
and there was no smell of alcohol.</p>

<p>“Blood!” shouted Harman. “We’re made!
Where’s your pocketbook? Gimme it!
Come on, haste yourself; come with me and
try to look like a fool. Gimme the pocketbook,
I tell you, and don’t ask no questions;
I’m fit to burst, and there’s no time. They’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
handlin’ the sails on that bathtub. Up with
you and after me!”</p>

<p>He seized the pocketbook, which had fifteen
hundred dollars in it, the remains of their
money, and rushed on deck, followed by
Blood.</p>

<p>The boat was still by the side, with two
Chinamen in her. They got in and rowed to
the <em>Bertha Mason</em>.</p>

<p>Next moment they were on the deck of the
<em>Bertha</em>, facing Gadgett.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gadgett,” said Harman, “when you
talked of having put down oyster spat in the
lagoon, did you mean pearl-oyster spat?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Gadgett, scenting vaguely
what was coming.</p>

<p>“And will them oysters have pearls in them
by next Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Of course they will,” replied the other.
“Not every oyster, but most of them will.”</p>

<p>“You talked of selling the remains of the
lease of the place,” said Harman. “Well,
we’ve come to buy. What would you want for
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two thousand dollars,” said Gadgett.
They went below to bargain, and in five minutes,
anxious to be done with the fools and
get away, Gadgett came down to five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>He knew well that not only was the place
stripped by him, but that lately it had been
giving out. Oysters are among the most mysterious
denizens of the sea, and shell lagoons
“give out” for no known reason. The oysters
cease to breed&mdash;that is all. Gadgett would
have sold the remains of his lease for five dollars,
for five cents, for a cent. He would have
given it away&mdash;to an enemy.</p>

<p>He got five hundred dollars for it and reckoned
that he had crowned his luck.</p>

<p>Harman went below and examined the
lease. It included all rights on the island
above and underground, and all rights to sea
approaches and reefs.</p>

<p>Gadgett had a government stamp for the
new contract. He was a man who always
foresaw, and in five minutes Harman and
Blood found themselves in possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Matao for a term of forty-four years, with an
option of renewal for another twenty years on
a year’s notice.</p>

<p>Then Harman, with this in his pocket, came
on deck, followed by Blood, and as they stood
saying good-bye to Gadgett the fellow in command
began giving the order to handle the
throat and peak halyards.</p>

<p>As they rowed off, the jib was being set, and
when they reached the <em>Heart</em>, the sound of the
windlass pawls reached them, and the rasp of
the anchor chain being hove short.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Blood, who knew Harman
too well to doubt that they had got the
weather gauge on Gadgett.</p>

<p>“Wait till they’ve cleared the lagoon&mdash;wait
till they’ve cleared the lagoon!” said the other.
“I’m afraid of thinkin’ of it lest that chap
should smell the idea and come back and murder
us. Oh, Lord, oh, Lord! Will they never
get out?”</p>

<p>The anchor of the <em>Bertha Mason</em> was now
rising to the catheads; she was moving. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
she passed the reef opening, she ran up her
flag and dipped it, then the Pacific took her.</p>

<p>“Come down below,” said Harman.</p>

<p>Down below, not a word would he say till
he had poured out two whiskies, one for himself
and one for Blood.</p>

<p>Then he burst out:</p>

<p>“It’s a guano island. Yesterday, when I
went fishin’, I took notice of signs, then I prospected.
All the top part is one solid block of
guano&mdash;nuff to manure the continent of the
States. That chap has been sittin’ five years
on millions of dollars and playin’ with oyster
shells. Oh, think of Rafferty&mdash;and the wheelbarrows!
Think of his long, yellow face when
he knows!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” said Blood.</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;why, I’ve a workin’ knowledge of
guano. Sure&mdash;o’ course I’m sure! Come
ashore with me, and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>They went ashore, and before sunset Harman
had demonstrated that even on this side,
where the deposit was thinnest, the store was
vast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Think of the size of the place,” said he,
“and remember from this to the other side it
gets thicker. Fifty years won’t empty it.”</p>

<p>The sea gulls of a thousand years had presented
them with a fortune beyond estimation,
and Blood for the first time in his life saw
himself a rich man&mdash;honestly rich.</p>

<p>Their joy was so great that the first thing
they did on returning to the <em>Heart</em> was to fling
the whisky bottle into the lagoon.</p>

<p>“We don’t want any more of that hell stuff
ever,” said Blood. “I want to enjoy life, and
that spoils everything.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” said Harman, “not to say
I’m goin’ to turn teetotal, for I’ve took notice
that them mugs gets so full of themselves they
haven’t cargo room for nuthin’ else. But I
don’t want no more drunks&mdash;not me.”</p>

<p>During the next fortnight, with the help of
the wheelbarrows and agricultural implements,
they took in a cargo of guano. Then
they sailed for Frisco.</p>

<p>I never heard exactly the amount of money
they made over their last sea adventure, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
do know for a fact that Rafferty nearly died
from “mortification” and that Blood and Harman
are exceedingly rich men.</p>

<p>Blood turned gentleman and married; but
Billy Harman is just the same, preferring sailormen
as company and taking voyages to his
island to sniff the source of his wealth and for
the good of his health.</p>

<p>Billy is the only man I have ever known
unspoiled by money.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
